Scripted Event Test Bundles

Each file represents a separate test bundle with a collection of tests.

Test info is written to the user profile HOI4 directory under logs/tests/tests_<timestamp>.log

Syntax:
----------------

# After last_date, the whole test bundle will be considered complete, and a
# final report will be logged for all the tests in this bundle.
last_date = "1945.1.1"

tests = {

	# The token is used as the name of the test in reports.
	germany_defeats_france = {
		# If this test fails at or below the following rate, it is not really a
		# significant failure, but represents randomness that is considered
		# acceptable.  Useful when executing multiple runs, such as on multiple
		# computers on automated overnight runs.  Defaults to 0.
		acceptable_fail_rate = 0.1
		
		# success is an and-trigger that, when true, reports a success to the
		# test log, and decrements the number of remaining runs left for the test.
		success = {
			date > "1939.1.1"
			date < "1941.1.1"
			FRA = { has_capitulated = yes }
		}
		
		# fail is an and-trigger that, when true, reports a failure to the
		# test log, and decrements the number of remaining runs left for the test.
		# A save file will also be generated based on the moment in the game when
		# this test failed, in the default save directory with the file name
		# TEST_FAIL_<test-name>_<game-date>.hoi4.
		fail = {
			date > "1941.1.1"
		}
		
		# success and fail triggers should be continuously evaluated until the
		# total number of times that either one evaluated to true has reached
		# run_count.  After this point, the test is no longer evaluated.
		# Defaults to 1.  If set to -1, the test will never quit evaluating.
		run_count = 1
		
		# A list of loggers that will report additional info in the log file
		# whenever the success or fail trigger evaluates to true.
		loggers = {
			log_equipment_in_field = {
				country = GER
				value = medium_tank_equipment
