 MEX_church_power_1_desc:0 "The Catholic Church in Mexico will become a thing of the past. The priests are counter-revolutionaries and peddlers of superstitious nonsense. We will press ever harder to turn Mexico into a bastion of rationalism and science!"

 MEX_politicised_army_desc:0 "The rulers of Mexico have been drawn from revolutionary army officers for almost three decades. The turbulent times we went through demanded firm leadership. The question is: has the turbulence passed, or is it becoming more severe? Should we professionalize the army or allow regional strongmen - caciques and caudillos - to carve out petty fiefdoms?

 HOL_aloof_neutrality_desc:0 "A policy of strict Neutrality has kept the Dutch out of wars with any of its neighbours for nearly 150 years, and, above all, has kept them out of the Great War. The public's belief in their "talisman of protection" is therefore almost fervent, and the weak Dutch government finds itself unable to go against the will of the people and take a strong stand in international politics. Instead, it has resolved to put its faith in the League of Nations, and otherwise adopts an aloof attitude to world events."

As a result, a strong pacifist movement has grown to permeate large parts of the public, and presents the government with great difficulties in implementing any increase of military expenditure. Only the navy still enjoys a certain measure of prestige in the public eye.\n\nA defensive war or a "war on pacifism" would be needed to truly rid the country of this sentiment."

The Dutch decision to maintain the Gold Standard, while other nations abandoned it rather quickly, has further exacerbated the "crisis years" in the Netherlands tremendously. In keeping the Guilder from devaluating, no funds are left to aid the ailing Dutch economy, let alone improve the poor state of national defenses.\n\nThe crisis can be reduced by investing in public works, and will become largely irrelevant if we capitulate and lose control of the crisis-stricken mainland."
