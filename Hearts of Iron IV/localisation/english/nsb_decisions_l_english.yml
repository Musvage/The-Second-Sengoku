 BALTIC_entente:0 "The Baltic Entente"
 BALTIC_entente_desc:0 "We Balts share a brotherhood, characterised by our long history of suffering under foreign imperialism.

 convert_neighbours_baltic_cat:0 "Spread the Revolution"
 convert_neighbours_baltic_cat_desc:0 "The revolution has been a resounding success here in [Root.GetNameDef], all that remains now is to spread the word of the revolution to our fellow Baltic brothers.

 BALTIC_promote_communism:0 "Socialist Propaganda in [From.Owner.GetNameDef]"
 BALTIC_promote_communism_desc:0 "Many of [From.Owner.GetNameDef]’s peasantry still see socialism as the enemy to their way of life. Although we may never heal the scars that the Red Army left behind, we may convince them that our flavour of revolution is not so bloody."

 infiltrate_belarus_decisions:0 "Infiltrate Belarus"
 infiltrate_belarus_decisions_desc:0 "The USSR claims to represent the interest of the Belarussian lower classes, but the Baltic socialists claim this to be pure posturing. They claim that [SOV.GetLeader] is a bourgeois dictator in every sense of the word, and it is only by arming the people of Belarus that they may truly be liberated in a socialist state."
 BALTIC_promote_unity_BLR:0 "Contest Control in [From.GetName]"

 LIT_promote_fascism:0 "Fascist Propaganda in Poland"
 LIT_promote_fascism_desc:0 "For decades, fascism has been pushed into the fringes of Polish politics. While we would love for the Poles to rise up for themselves, they scarcely stand a chance if we do not openly promote fascism in their nation."
 LIT_promote_falange_militancy:0 "Support Falangist Militants"
 LIT_promote_falange_militancy_desc:0 "The [POL.GetFascistParty] is infamous for its riotous and violent methods of demonstration.

 LIT_ignite_civil_war_in_POL_desc:0 "The preparations have been made. Poland will soon be a battleground not just of ideas but of valour and glory. We have done all we can to support the Falangists in Poland, all we need do now is cast the die and hope that God truly is on their side."
 march_through_estonia:0 "The March Through Estonia"
 march_through_estonia_desc:0 "The weak government of Konstantin Päts has silenced the cry of Estonia’s patriots for long enough. We lack the manpower to fight the Estonian armed forces alone, but perhaps by demonstrating our frustration with the dictatorship in a series of marches throughout the country, we may remind the youth of Estonia that their fathers fought for a good life for them that Päts and his cabal are denying them."
 EST_stomp_the_vaps:0 "Incoming Government Crackdown"
 EST_stomp_the_vaps_desc:1 "[EST.GetLeader] knows that we seek to disrupt [EST.GetLeader.GetHerHis] regime and [EST.GetLeader.GetSheHe] is making preparations to crackdown on us and bring an end to our marches. If we do not succeed in toppling the government before then, Estonia faces a civil war!"

 promote_baltic_fascism_cat:0 "Promote Baltic Fascism"
 promote_baltic_fascism_cat_desc:1 "The Baltic is characterised by its weak infantile regimes incapable of representing the blood of the Balts that flows through the veins of their people.

 LAT_promote_fascism:0 "Fascist Propaganda in [From.Owner.GetNameDef]"
 LAT_promote_fascism_desc:0 "Many individuals in [From.Owner.GetNameDef] have not yet accepted that their [From.Owner.GetFascistParty] party is the only way that the [From.Owner.GetAdjective] people may at last rule themselves.

 LIT_iron_wolf_coup:0 "The Iron Wolf Coup"
 LIT_iron_wolf_coup_desc:0 "The followers of Augustinas Voldemaras are organizing a rebellion within our nation. If nothing is done to circumvent the Iron Wolf, we risk falling into a civil war.

 LIT_iron_wolf_partisans:0 "Iron Wolf Partisans"
 LIT_iron_wolf_partisans_desc:0 "The Iron Wolf are organizing in our nation. Over time, they will inevitably increase their support among the Lithuanian people and may eventually feel emboldened to commit a coup on the government."
 LIT_iron_wolf_appeasement:0 "Delay the Iron Wolf Uprising"
 LIT_iron_wolf_appeasement_desc:0 "We must make efforts to disrupt the activities of the Iron Wolf in our nation. Though none of these measures will stamp them out completely, we may be able to delay their efforts long enough to find a permanent solution."

 LIT_relocate_iron_wolf_recruitment_desc:0 "The Iron Wolf rely on local recruiters to bring new men into their ranks. By forcefully relocating these recruiters, we will confuse any would-be followers and potentially prevent their entry into the Iron Wolf group."
 LIT_promote_alternative_paramilitaries:0 "Promote Alternative Paramilitaries"
 LIT_promote_alternative_paramilitaries_desc:0 "While we would wish our citizens to join the official Lithuanian military, it is inevitable that some would rather owe their allegiance to a group divorced from the government.

 EST_vaps_revolt_category_desc:0 "A series of veteran’s societies throughout Estonia have organized into a single fascist entity known as the Vaps Movement which threatens to overthrow the government.

 EST_vaps_uprising:0 "Vaps Marching on Tallinn"
 EST_vaps_uprising_desc:0 "The Vaps continue to march and demonstrate throughout Estonia despite being an illegal organization. The longer we leave this group of nationalists to fester, the more we risk others joining their cause."
 EST_vaps_crackdown:0 "Crackdown on the Vaps"
 EST_vaps_crackdown_desc:0 "We are coordinating a total crackdown on all societies associated with the Vaps Movement.

 EST_fight_vaps_decisions:0 "Fight the Vaps"
 EST_fight_vaps_decisions_desc:0 "The Vaps Movement must be countered if our crackdown is to be successful. Actions that disrupt the Vaps will drastically decrease their influence in our nation and will make their forceful removal all the smoother."

 EST_divide_veterans_societies_desc:0 "The Vaps are primarily comprised of those who fought in the Estonian War of Independence, and though it is sad to see our heroes fall under the sway of ultranationalism, we must break up and divide the veteran’s societies that the Vaps have united."
 EST_disrupt_vaps_recruitment:0 "Disrupt Vapsid Recruitment"
 EST_disrupt_vaps_recruitment_desc:0 "Though the Vaps are traditionally veterans ranging from middle age to elderly, they are not short of young sympathisers seeking to join in the name of their fathers and grandfathers.

 EST_delay_the_crackdown:0 "Delay the Crackdown"
 EST_delay_the_crackdown_desc:0 "Although we would prefer that the Vaps be dealt with expediently, we cannot risk throwing the country into disarray and the crackdown must be postponed."

 LAT_equality_campaigns_desc:0 "The Pērkonkrusts are opposed to [Root.GetLeader]’s mission to create a Latvia where the sun shines equally over all Latvians, and as such we must make it clear that supporting their supremacist narrative opposes the core values of our nation."
 LAT_empower_democrats:0 "Empower Democrats"
 LAT_empower_democrats_desc:0 "Though undesirable, the democrats are vocal opponents of the Pērkonkrusts and pose a much smaller threat to our nation. This will increase support for the democratic opposition, but we must do everything we can to curb the activities of the Pērkonkrusts."

 POL_purchase_madagascar:0 "Purchase [543.GetName]"
 POL_purchase_madagascar_desc:0 "Madagascar is an alien landscape, full of flora and fauna unfamiliar to Poles. Although many would see this as making the island inhospitable to Poles, some could see it as an opportunity to live somewhere entirely new.
