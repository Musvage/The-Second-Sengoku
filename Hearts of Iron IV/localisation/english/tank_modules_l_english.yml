 gwtank_chassis:0 "Inter-War Tank Development"
 gwtank_chassis_desc:0 "The tank has proven itself a powerful weapon in the Great War. While development has slowed in the intervening years, it is no doubt going to play a major role in the wars to come."
 armor_tech_1:0 "Basic Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_1_desc:0 "Tanks during the Great War only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armor. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
 armor_tech_2:0 "Improved Armor Protection"

 armor_tech_4:0 "Modern Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_4_desc:0 "During the war, the threats faced by tanks have multiplied, from enemy tanks, anti-tank guns, dedicated tank destroyers, all the way to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges that can penetrate even heavy armor. We must develop new protection methods to keep our own tanks alive in the face of these threats."
 engine_tech_1:0 "Basic Engine"
 engine_tech_1_desc:0 "Where the tanks of the Great War were slow, lumbering beasts, the modern tank relies very much on speed and mobility to achieve victory."

 engine_tech_3:0 "Advanced Engine"
 engine_tech_3_desc:0 "Mechanized warfare is a form of combat that requires fast decision making and fast movement of troops and supplies. If our tanks are to carry modern weapons and enough armor to survive on the battlefield, they require powerful engines to keep up with the motorized infantry."
 engine_tech_4:0 "Modern Engine"
 engine_tech_4_desc:0 "The numerous new additions to tanks made necessary by modern warfare have increased the weight of the vehicle substantially. To move all that mass around, we require engines that have a lot of power behind them."

 tank_rocket_launcher:0 "Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_desc:0 "A multi-barrelled launcher for unguided, high-explosive rockets. The high volume of fire gives it excellent performance against soft targets, but even direct hits do little against armored targets."
 tank_rocket_launcher_2:0 "Improved Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_2_desc:0 "While there are a number of improvements to accuracy, the main advantage of this improved rocket launcher is that it can hold more rockets to fire at the enemy."
 tank_wheeled_suspension:0 "Wheeled Suspension"
 tank_wheeled_suspension_desc:0 "Derived from a truck chassis, this suspension is very limited in its carrying capacity and has limited cross-country performance, but has the advantage of being very cheap to make."

 squeezebore_adaptor:0 "Squeeze-bore Adaptor"
 squeezebore_adaptor_desc:0 "A special adaptor at the end of the gun lowers the diameter of the barrel and squeezes a shell down to a smaller caliber. This significantly increases muzzle velocity and thereby the penetration power of the gun. It does require special ammunition made from rare materials."
