This culminated in the Mukden Incident in 1932, when the Empire of Manchukuo was carved out of the petty warlords of the north-east. The Kwantung Army continues to dominate the area and places the interests of their generals above the needs of Manchukuo.\n\nWe will only resolve this by getting the Japanese army to recognise us as equals, or by throwing them out by force."
