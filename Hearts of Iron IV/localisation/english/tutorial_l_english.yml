 tut_12_text_1:1 "Ethiopia has surrendered! You have won!\nYou can now make demands during the §YPeace Conference§!.

You can see the range by selecting a £GFX_supply_hub_texticon §YSupply Hub§! and holding £GFX_shift. Range can be affected by motorization which consumes £GFX_unit_motorized_icon_small trucks.\n\nEfficiency is further affected by the level of the £GFX_railways_texticon §YRailways§! and £GFX_naval_supply_hub_texticon §YNaval Bases§!, lack of £GFX_train_texticon §YTrains§!, and enemy air strikes. This creates §Rbottlenecks§!. These can be mitigate by upgrading the railways to the capital supply hub, provide air defences with figters and make sure to have enough trains.

Certain countries may have certain §YDiplomatic Actions§! locked until World Tension is high enough.\n\nGenerally speaking, Axis powers want the World Tension to stay low to prevent Democratic countries from intervening, while Democratic countries want World Tension to be high so that they can intervene.\n\nDeclaring War, justifying claims, annexing territory, completing certain §YNational Focuses§! are all examples of action that might increase World Tension.\n\nThe higher the World Tension is, the closer you are to a World War."
