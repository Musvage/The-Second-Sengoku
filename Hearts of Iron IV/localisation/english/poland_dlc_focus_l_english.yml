 POL_abolish_segregated_seating_desc:0 "Poland is a landscape of people of different ethnicities, cultures, and faiths, yet in our education we keep them separate.

 POL_agrarian_reform:0 "Agrarian Reform"
 POL_agrarian_reform_desc:2 "A peasant’s strike is on the horizon. All across the country, food prices are skyrocketing, and both our disjointed industry and the government’s lack of action to aid Poland’s poorest cause great unrest in the peasantry. With sufficient investment and reform however, we should be able to become more than capable of meeting the peasants’ demands."
 POL_invest_in_eastern_poland:0 "Invest in Eastern Poland"
 POL_invest_in_eastern_poland_desc:0 "The east is a barren and desolate place, neglected entirely by both the Russians and the Polish state. There is a plethora of ideal locations for factories, and plenty of men with which to work them, should we choose to invest in such things."

 POL_woo_the_sanation_generals_desc:0 "The Sanationist military staff are disgruntled and disloyal towards the regime. Some would say that a purge of military staff is necessitated by the Sanation’s own hubris, but we know these men are simply too valuable to be replaced."

 POL_attract_foreign_motors:0 "Attract Foreign Motor Companies"
 POL_attract_foreign_motors_desc:0 "While some would insist that the original Polish designs of LRL are where the future of Polish motorized equipment lies, the question remains why should we reinvent the wheel when we can merely realign it?

 POL_adaptive_designs:0 "Adaptive Designs"
 POL_adaptive_designs_desc:0 "Maintaining our licence for foreign designers is coming to be of great expense to the state, but perhaps there are ways we can repurpose our military designs to be of use in the private sector.

 POL_consolidate_sanation_government:0 "Consolidate the Sanation Government"
 POL_consolidate_sanation_government_desc:1 "Since the death of Józef Piłsudski, the Sanation government has been fragmented and disorganized. The government has split into three branches: The Castle, the Sanation Left, and the Sanation Right.

 POL_the_castle:0 "The Castle"
 POL_the_castle_desc:0 "The Castle represents the governors ruling from Warsaw Castle under the leadership of Ignacy Mościcki.

 POL_eliminate_socialist_parties:0 "Eliminate Socialist Parties"
 POL_eliminate_socialist_parties_desc:0 "Socialism is an ideology rapidly taking hold of the world, but it is fundamentally incompatible with the ideals of the Castle government. The left oppose us in both the form of agrarian and social-democrat parties, and in the traitorous communist parties. Socialism of all forms must not be accepted and all social parties must be banned for the sake of the continued stability and security of the Polish state."
 POL_dissolve_the_sejm:0 "Dissolve the Sejm"
 POL_dissolve_the_sejm_desc:0 "The Sejm has continued to exist under the Sanation government as a mere token of the democracy Poland once embraced. The time has come however to strip the Sejm of all powers and grant all power to the Senate and the Senators of the Castle."

 POL_the_sanation_left:0 "The Sanation Left"
 POL_the_sanation_left_desc:1 "Loyal to Walery Sławek, the Sanation Left represents those who feel Sławek is the true successor to Piłsudski and seek accommodation with the opposition, rather than ostracising them from government entirely as the Right and Castle would. Though cooperation with them will likely upset the Sanation Right, the leftists hold internal power that we need to build a competent cabinet of ministers."
 POL_modus_vivendi:0 "Modus Vivendi"
 POL_modus_vivendi_desc:0 "The Sanation Left seeks accommodation with the opposition within our state; granting them seats of power within the government. With members of the opposition given proper representation, they may no longer seek to oppose the Dictatorship."
 POL_draft_a_new_constitution:0 "Draft a New Constitution"
 POL_draft_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "It has long been Sławek’s ambition to amend the constitution of Poland, and given the right to do so may grant us more direct control over the Polish state and further improve the April Constitution."

 POL_legion_of_merit:0 "The Legion of Merit"
 POL_legion_of_merit_desc:0 "A conception of Walery Sławek, the Legion of Merit would award a privileged position to any citizens of the republic who have proven themselves to be of outstanding benefit to the state. The award would guarantee the individual a position in the senate, and any individual invited to the Legion would certainly have little reason to grow disgruntled with the regime."
 POL_the_left_chairman:0 "The Left Chairman"
 POL_the_left_chairman_desc:0 "The Sanations Left and Right are fundamentally incompatible ideologically. While we may be able to benefit from reforms proposed by the Right, it is the Left who has the best interests of Poland at heart and perhaps by granting them greater powers, we may sideline the Right entirely…"
 POL_common_organization_of_society:0 "Common Organization of Society"
 POL_common_organization_of_society_desc:0 "Sławek has long had the ambition to replace the BBWR with a power structure he calls the “Common Organization of Society”. This structure would uniquely grant great local autonomy to Poland’s states and townships, while centralizing the government in a strong authoritarian regime ready to interfere in local governance in times of war. With the Left in power, Sławek may at last fulfill his ambition."
 POL_dissolve_the_bbwr:0 "A New King in the Castle"
 POL_dissolve_the_bbwr_desc:0 "The Left have grown so influential and powerful within the Dictatorship that Mościcki’s title of President seems entirely symbolic at best. All that remains is to make it official and disband all traces of the Castle from government, bringing Sławek to the lofty peak of power in the state."
 POL_the_sanation_right:0 "The Sanation Right"
 POL_the_sanation_right_desc:0 "Followers of Edward Rydz-Śmigły, the Sanation Right is primarily composed of generals and high ranking military staff. The military powerhouse of the Sanation government, the Right are in prime position to take control of the government, but granting powers and concessions to them may ensure their continued loyalty and potential incorporation into the Castle."
 POL_support_right_paramilitaries:0 "Support Right-Wing Paramilitarism"
 POL_support_right_paramilitaries_desc:0 "The Falangists of Poland’s political landscape have often been described as fanatical, fascist, and even comparable with the Nazis, but their rhetoric is appealing to Polish patriots, and Jerzy Rutkowski proposes establishing a paramilitary composed of youthful volunteers ready to fight and die for Polish independence."
 POL_codify_national_unity:0 "Codify the Camp of National Unity"
 POL_codify_national_unity_desc:0 "The Camp of National Unity represents the joint interests of the Sanation Right and the Castle, and thus far the policies and goals of the group have been vague. However, we may amend the April Constitution to lock our values of nationalism, law and order, and anti-communism into the foundation of our republic."
 POL_second_man_of_the_state:0 "Second Man of the State"
 POL_second_man_of_the_state_desc:0 "The Sanation Left has been sufficiently sidelined and now, Śmigły and Mościcki are able to completely oust the Left of all influence in the government. Śmigły shall be made the “second man”, meaning that in times of war, Mościcki must surrender his seat as President to the Sanation Right and the military."
 POL_ozon:1 "Triumph of OZN"
 POL_ozon_desc:0 "Though the agreement is that Mościcki surrenders his seat in times of war, it is clear that the threats on our border are more than we can stand against and war is on the horizon.

 POL_lithuanian_ultimatum:0 "Lithuanian Ultimatum"
 POL_lithuanian_ultimatum_desc:0 "For years, we have officially been in a state of war with the Lithuanians though nobody has taken aggressive action since the annexation of Vilnius. With Germany storming across the continent taking what it desires with the mere threat of war, perhaps we may do the same for Lithuania; demanding an end to these hostilities for the sake of both our nations."
 POL_lithuanian_alliance:0 "Lithuanian Alliance"
 POL_lithuanian_alliance_desc:0 "We have made peace with our former enemies to the north, but now we must learn how to move forward together as friends. Our enemies and allies are common, so it is only natural that the Lithuanians be aligned with the same powers as us."
 POL_lithuanian_annexation:0 "Demand Lithuanian Annexation"
 POL_lithuanian_annexation_desc:0 "With the German anschluss of Austria, it’s become evident that old unions can be restored if one merely asks for it with some aggression.

 POL_restore_the_sejm:0 "Restore the Sejm"

 POL_the_prusya_line:1 "The Prussian Line"
 POL_the_prusya_line_desc:0 "East Prussia is a key invasion point for the Germans, and a great gap in our current defences. By expanding out fortline along the Prussian border, our armies will be more capable of defending our nation from the threat to our north."
 POL_invest_anti_air:0 "Invest in Anti-Air"
 POL_invest_anti_air_desc:0 "We are unlikely to be capable of outproducing the Germans in the air, however we need not outnumber them when we can instead invest heavily in constructing anti-air weaponry on the ground. With Bofors in every state, German pilots won’t get far before meeting our guns."
