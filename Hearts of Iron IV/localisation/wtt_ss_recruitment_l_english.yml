Security Services have so far been unable to get a man on the inside, but all officers confimred to be connected to this "Prussian Circle" have been very outspoken about their disdain of the national-socialist government and particular its decision to expand the Waffen-SS.\n\nThere is currently little indication of what the ultimate goal of this plot is, or if indeed it hs a goal at all."

The exact contents of these consultations are unknown, but it stands to reason that they are connected to the continued frustrations of Himmler with the leadership of the party. [GER.GetLeader] still seems to follow the advice of the Wehrmacht when it comes to military matters, blocking Himmler's attempts at creating and expanding an independent armed force as a counterweight.\n\nRumor has it that Himmler has instead turned his attention towards creating what he calls "a new Order of Teutonic Knights for a new Germany". These "Knights" swear fanatical loyalty and unquestioning obedience to Himmler personally and are each gifted a sword made to Himmler's design from steel blessed in old Germanic rituals - presumably to slay the enemies of the New Germany."

I don't care where or how I get what I need for that.'"

Over dozens of pages, it details how the SS could use its diminished but still substantial powers to seize control over the government 'in the event that [GER.GetLeader] betrays the national-socialist cause'. Evidence for such a betrayal, the paper continues, would be a lack of commitment to replacing existing obsolete organisations such as the Army with new formations built in the right national-socialist character.\n\nThe memo bears the signature of Heinrich Himmler."

Clearly overtaken by his lust for power, the Reichsführer SS tried to kill [GER.GetLeader], but the gun jammed and didn't fire. In the moment of confusion, the Führer managed to overpower Himmler and shout for help. Reportedly, it took four members of his guard detail to restrain Himmler.\n\nElsewhere in the Reich, a number of tense standoffs between SS and regular Army units ensued as the former attempted to seize key communication posts but eventually withdrew after hearing that [GER.GetLeader] had survived.\n\nWehrmacht units have the main SS offices and holdings surrounded and are awaiting orders from Berlin."

According to his testimony, the Führer, clearly gripped by madness, had declared him a complete failure of a man and a soldier, a traitor and a spy to be shot at dawn. Realizing that he must choose between his personal honor and the survival of the nation, Himmler decided to act immediately and shot him. In the aftermath, members of the Führer's guard detail attempted to kill Himmler as an assassin. Only the timely arrival of Himmler's own bodyguards saved the Reichsführer SS.\n\n Across Germany, the news of the death of the Führer has evidently served as a signal to put long-prepared into action. Both SS and regular Army units raced to secure bridges, telephone exchanges and crossroads, with Luftwaffe paratroopers rapidly mobilizing to seize airfields all across the Reich.\n\nGermany stands at the edge of a civil war, and all three factions will rely on the civilian government to actually run the country."
