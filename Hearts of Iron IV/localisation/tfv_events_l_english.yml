 tfv_australia.1.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Proposal about the Singapore Strategy"
 tfv_australia.1.d:0 "The Singapore Strategy has been the cornerstone of our deterrence policy against [JAP.GetNameDef] since the end of the Great War. However, the redeployment of the Main Fleet to Singapore in case of attack is reliant on support from our allies in [From.GetNameDef]. With the potential threat against British holdings in the Far East increasing by the day, the [From.GetAdjective] high command has presented a potential new stratagem, that would see Australia in far greater control of the defense of the region.\n\nIt's a sound plan, and the only question is whether we believe they can provide the security we require."

 tfv_australia.3.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Strategic Adjustments"
 tfv_australia.3.d:0 "Despite our valid concerns about the viability of the Singapore Strategy, our suggestions to change it have been rejected in the [From.GetAdjective] parliament. \nThis seems a result of the military conservatism dominating the [From.GetAdjective] High Command, but the fact is that if our fears come to pass, we may have to face enemy forces on our shores."

It would mean that for the foreseeable future said territory would only be nominally [Root.GetAdjective], but nominal ownership is surely better than completely losing them."

 tfv_australia.12.d:0 "Believing themselves to be sufficiently capable of protecting [From.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia, [From.GetNameDef] has refused our proposal of a shared defense strategy.\n\nUndoubtedly motivated by worries of colonial control, their actions are understandable. However, if they are incapable of protecting their territory - as we fear - we may see it used as the launch platform for an attack on the Australian continent."
 tfv_australia.12.a:0 "We can only hope they will be able to resist."
 tfv_australia.20.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Our Annexation!"
 tfv_australia.20.d:0 "We have long worryingly followed the growth of nationalistic fervor in [From.GetNameDef], and it seems as though the day has finally come when it has spilled out past their own borders.\nCiting a common heritage as "pioneer nations," suggestions have been floated of a united state of Oceania. Rhetoric has turned increasingly aggressive in the face of [Root.GetAdjective] resistance, however.\n\nNow political speculation has turned to open hostility, and [From.GetLeader] publicly demands the annexation of all [Root.GetAdjective] territory to the state of [From.GetNameDef].\nIf we refuse, a forceful invasion seems entirely possible."
 tfv_australia.20.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept our new status as a province of [From.GetNameDef]."

 tfv_australia.21.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] has folded to our ultimatum, and accepts their new status as a province of [Root.GetNameDef]. While [From.GetAdjective] PM [From.GetLeader] mourns the loss of [From.GetAdjective] "independence," this moment marks the beginning of a new era for Oceania.\n\n[From.GetNameDef], like us, are now done being the lapdogs of an Empire that does not have our interests at heart."

 tfv_australia.22.d:0 "Failing to acknowledge their precarious position in the geopolitical landscape of the Pacific, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer to make New Zealand one of the foremost provinces of [Root.GetNameDef].\nNot realizing they are merely Britain's lapdog, [From.GetAdjective] Premier [From.GetLeader] cited principles of [From.GetAdjective] "freedom and independence."\n\nIt seems we have to remind [From.GetNameDef] exactly what we mean by describing their position as "geopolitically precarious.""
 tfv_australia.22.a:0 "To arms, [Root.GetAdjective]s!"
 tfv_australia.31.t:0 "[Root.GetNameDefCap] as a Global Leader"
 tfv_australia.31.d:0 "Following our recent policy of distancing ourselves from the Empire, it only makes sense for a country as dominant as we are in our own sphere to assume the position of a leader, rather than a follower.\nWe will gather other regional powers to our cause, and ensure that our mutual interests are defended on the global stage.\n\nNo longer in servitude to the colonial powers of Europe, we will ensure a new, more just balance of power."

 tfv_australia.32.d:0 "Following the formal departure of [From.GetNameDef] from the Commonwealth, the [From.GetAdjective] government is now looking for new allies. With Europe seemingly on the brink of a new, costly conflict, and the strategic value of [From.GetNameDef] to any potential conflict in the Pacific, a partnership may be in our best interest.\n\nIt would certainly emphasize Southeast Asia, the Far East and the Pacific as parts of our sphere of influence, and ensure that no matter what happens in Europe, [Root.GetAdjective] interests will not be intruded upon."
 tfv_australia.32.a:1 "We would be happy to call them our ally!"
 tfv_australia.32.b:0 "We can protect our interests better on our own."

 tfv_australia.34.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Declines Cooperation Project"
 tfv_australia.34.d:0 "Whether it is failure to acknowledge our shared history, or simply a matter of political opportunism, [From.GetNameDef] has declined our offer of a transpacific partnership.\n\nWhile their participation would have been a great asset, we should move forwards with our own agenda, towards our own goals."
 tfv_australia.34.a:0 "We will still do what we can for our corner of the world."

 tfv_australia.41.d:0 "With turmoil rampant in the former [HOL.GetAdjective] colonies, it is apparent that [INS.GetNameDef], our trusted neighbor, requires a helping hand to maintain their hard-won authority. For as long as they need our support, [Root.GetNameDef] is there to support the [INS.GetAdjective] government.\n\nOne day [INS.GetNameDef] will be able to stand up to European colonial forces as our Pacific brother. Until then, we will ensure they stand strong along with us."

 tfv_australia.50.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Requests Membership in the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 tfv_australia.50.d:0 "Identifying as a nation of workers, free of the old European bourgeoisie, [From.GetNameDef] has gradually moved into the [Root.GetAdjective] sphere of politics. The [From.GetAdjective] government has officially requested national membership in the [Root.GetFactionName].\n\nWith the World Revolution in sight, [From.GetLeader] presents a vision of [Root.GetNameDef] and [From.GetNameDef] as two of the key poles in a new, Socialist world order, building on [From.GetNameDef]'s dominance in Oceania, and [Root.GetNameDef]'s in Eurasia."
 tfv_australia.50.a:0 "Any revolutionary nation is welcomed with open arms!"

 tfv_australia.52.d:0 "Following weeks of stalled negotiations and bureaucratic trappings, it has become apparent that [From.GetNameDef] are not interested in giving us a definitive answer on our accession to the [From.GetFactionName].\nAs we were hoping for quick and conclusive negotiations, [Root.GetNameDef] must prepare to bring true freedom to the workers of the world on her own."

 tfv_australia.60.d:0 "Citing the rights of all workers to freedom and self-determination, the [From.GetAdjective] government is demanding that the [Root.GetAdjective] state gives in to the wave of "Oceanic Socialism" washing over our region.\n\nRegardless of the actual interest of the people of [Root.GetNameDef], the threat from [From.GetNameDef] is real, and there is little doubt that they are likely to press their demands with all means available to them..."

 tfv_australia.70.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Right to Control Protectorates"
 tfv_australia.70.d:0 "Claiming that a failure on the part of [Root.GetNameDef] to defend its colonial holdings in Southeast Asia would have catastrophic implications for [From.GetNameDef] national defense, [From.GetLeader] has requested that the [From.GetAdjective] government be given full, independent responsibility for the defense of the region.\nWhile not an outright demand, the growth of [From.GetAdjective] strategic and military influence in the region has the argument make some sense. The counterbalance being the recent political distancing from us that [From.GetNameDef] has embraced.\nThis would be an agreement with a potential partner, not a subject, and would leave the colonies de facto out of our hands, should [From.GetNameDef] choose to make it so."
 tfv_australia.70.a:0 "Yes, the stability of Southeast Asia is a priority."
