 tut_1_text_alert:0 "Start by §Ydealing with the alerts§! at the top of the screen."
 tut_2_text_1:0 "Good! Now that the alerts are sorted out you can start diving into the details of waging war. Italy starts at war with Ethiopia and you should not have much difficulty in winning that war once you learn how to do it.\n\nMove your camera in a south-eastwards direction until you find Eritrea in Africa. Once your camera location has changed, §Yselect the Divisions§! in the $STATE|Y$ state."
 tut_3_text_1:1 "Great! Now you will learn how to start planning an offensive.\n\nDivisions can join together in §YArmies§!. An Army is used to draw Battle Plans and they can be assigned a §YCommander§! to lead them.\n\nClick the §YNew Army§! button at the bottom of the screen."

 tut_6_text_1:0 "You have now created an Offensive Order to attack the Ethiopian capital. Before you go ahead and give the order to execute the plan, it may be wise to make the correct preparations.\n\nIf you allow your units to prepare for $DAYS_OF_PLANNING|0Y$ days they will receive a combat bonus for up to §G+$PLANNING_MAX|0%$§!. Certain £tech_mod  §YLand Doctrines§! can modify for how long you can §YPrepare§! while others might modify how fast you can reach your maximum level of Preparation.\n\nIt is also advisable that you prepare your Air Force as well. Click the §YAir Base§! in §YEritrea§!."
 tut_7_text_1:0 "Good! In order for your troops to have a higher guarantee of success in battle, it is also important to give them the proper §YAir Support§! they may require.\n\n§YAir Wings§! assigned to an §YAir Region§! can be sent on missions. §YSupport§! Air Wings can be sent on the §YClose Air Support§! mission, which will enable them to join land combat engagements.\n\nAssign the §YAir Wings§! based in the §YEritrea Air Base§! by right-clicking the §YEast-Africa Air Region§! and give them orders once they are assigned."
 tut_8_text_1:0 "Good! You now have §YAir Wings§! assigned to the East Africa §YAir Region§!. Before they start doing anything, however, you must first give your Air Wings §Ymissions§!. If an Air Wing does not have an active mission it will stay in the Air Base.\n\nThere are a number of different §YAir Missions§! and the Air Missions an Air Wing can be sent on depends on the type of the Air Wing. §YSupport Air Wings§! can be sent on the §YClose Air Support§! mission, which enables them to join land combat engagements and attack your enemies.\n\nTo send an Air Wing on a mission, click the mission icon in the Air Interface."

 tut_12_text_1:1 "Ethiopia has surrendered! You have won!\nYou can now make demands during the §YPeace Conference§!. We recommend that you choose to §YTake All States§!.\n\nEach demand you make will increase £world_tension_icon  §YWorld Tension§! by a certain amount. The higher the §YWorld Tension§! is, the closer you are to a World War.\n\nSome countries have certain §YDiplomatic Actions§! locked until World Tension is high enough. Read more in the hint below."
 tut_13_text_1:0 "You are victorious! The war is over and Ethiopia has been defeated.\n\nDuring peace time you may want to §Ytransport troops§! across the ocean to redeploy them to different locations, or perhaps to prepare for war. \n\nNow that Ethiopia has been defeated you do not need to have so many Divisions there.\n\nSelect at least §Y4 Divisions§! and move them to the §Yhighlighted port§! by right-clicking the province."

 HINT_RESEARCH_TREE_TEXT:0 "This is the §YResearch Tree§!. Although it might seem overwhelming at first, it is actually not too complicated. We have highlighted some technologies that are recommended to research in the beginning of the game.\n\nIt is a good idea to research technologies that boost your country's industrial base as well as more general military improvements. As the game progresses it might be valid to research more specialized Technologies such as Doctrines or Aircraft. It all depends on what you are trying to achieve.\n\nTechnologies take longer to research if you are trying to research something ahead of time.
