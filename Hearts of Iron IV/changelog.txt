########              Patch 1.9.1 "Husky"               ########
################################################################

##################################
# Balance
##################################
- lowered intel required for approximate army count & fielded manpower count to 5%
- Fixed upper bound of define for min legitimacy of government in exile to allow equipment transfer, which has the practical effect of increasing this min required legitimacy from 1 to 5.
- Fixed bounds of define for daily legitimacy change of liberated government in exile, which has the practical effect of changing the rate from -1 to -1.5 legitimacy per day.
- Soviet NKVD spirit now gives an extra operative slot
- SMERSH now gives +1 slot and coutner intel if you have LaR
- mitigated the effects of deleting your whole army to get more XP training exploit
- Add a max cap of 10 to operative number
- every country should now have access to a minister to unlock an extra operative slot
- decreased time taken to run collaboration regime from 190 to 90 days
- removed ignoring of resistance target changes to no garrison law if resistance is disabled
- increased compliance generation to 0.08% base from 0.07%
- decreased compliance decay to 0.08% from 0.1% at max compliance
- Rebalanced compliance gain
- changed compliance decay in occupation laws to match new compliance generation
- France now starts with basic heavy tanks unlocked
- France now has engineer companies attached to leg and motorized infantry divisions as well as light mechanized divisions in the 1936 start
- France can no longer gain up to 7 research slots by cleverly losing a war
- Death Before Surrender now is a timed spirit that lasts for 900 days. This means that, if the Civil War starts the earliest it can start, the spirit will be removed at the beginning of 1939, thus simulating a collapse of morale and speeding up the conclusion of the Civil War if it is still in progress.
- Anarchist divisions now spawn with only 25% equipment (unless the player/AI went down the Anarchists branch). This should make Anarchist Spain's starting position much weaker.
- 20% Reduction to Strengthen the Regime focus requirements (80k MP instead of 100k, 800 infantry eq. and 800 support eq. instead of 1k each)
- Increased minimum surrender limit to for a country to 20%
- Increased compliance decay to give cap of 90% compliance to non democracies.
- Changed compliance loss on state changing hands to 25% from 10%
- Decreased fielded manpower requirement from German "Demand Sudetenland" to 725000 from 750000
- Improved Resistance Suppression when using "Brutal Oppression" from 65% to 75%
- Decreased compliance from collab regime operation to 20% from 30% on normal result and 50% to 40% on excelent result
- changing ideology now halves compliance
- Reduced the Compliance requirements for the Anarchist coring decisions to 50%, down from 60%.
- Increased the cost of Concessions to the Anarchists decision to 150 PP to bring it more in line with its intended purpose as an 'emergency' delay rather than a permanent one, and also made it require either of the Nationalist factions to exist. This means that once those are defeated, there is no stopping the Anarchist uprising anymore.
- operative gained from faction members now is reduced for counties that lacks industry
- operations will now higher cost as you execute same operation on same targets (default is 15%. rescue operation is still 0%. Some exceptions are 25%)
- compliance is now halved (instead of factored by 75%) when a state controller is changed
- destroying the counter-revolution now prevents France from descending into another civil war against the fascists from low stability again
- Danzig and Memel are no longer required for forming Poland-Lithuania
- Memel is no longer required for forming the United Baltic States
- Political violence can no longer return to France if France has capitulated
- unprepared offensive modifier in SCW now also affect CAS impacts
- Along with Niceto Alcalá-Zamora as a leader, the Republicans will now, after the 1936 elections, receive a National Spirit reducing their political power income. Along with Zamora's trait and various tweaks and adjustments made to the political power gained through events and Republican focuses, this should make the flow of Garrison Control fighting before the SCW much more natural. Now, Nationalists get an initial advantage and a 'head start', but if the Republicans correctly focus on delaying the civil war initially, they will be rewarded and eventually be able to take more states back from the Nationalists than if they focus on taking states from the very start. Delaying the civil war should therefore be more enticing as a strategy.
- Increased tech stealing bonuses to 300% from 200%
- Increased tech stealing extra bonus outcomes to also give either 1 or 2 year ahead of time bonuses also
- Tech stealing can now unlock techs, uses weights on tech picking to prefer more up to date and equipment for a more rewarding bonus
- If Britain or France decide to abandon Czechoslovakia or Yugoslavia in their respective event chains, any guarantees they have made to those countries are revoked
- Medium Aircraft Designers now affect scout planes
- Added 4 civilian factories to Soviets
- added 1 mil and 2 civ factory to china
- changed one civ to 1 mil for PRC
- decreased manpower damage from resistance from 3% to 1.8%

################################################################

- Fixed naval supply paths to correctly take into account actual versus needed convoy counts when determining convoy efficiency.

- Med various code safer to avoid theoretically possible but improbable crashes.
- Fixed a resource leak of the ambient battle sound which also led to heavy audio falloff computations after a long time of watching battles closely. Sound effect instances were being stopped but never destroyed.
- Added an error and prevented a crash if a supply area is missing
- Fixed crash when loading a savegame while in a peace conference
- Fixed crash when adding manpower to casualties when the killer was not at war with the owner of the manpower ( for instance volunteers ), casualties will now be added to the logicalcountry of the army in such situations
- Fixed memory leak due to old messages piling up over time that were never used
- Optimized the amount of calculations related to front systems (base mechanics required by the battleplans) used by the volunteers battleplans.
- Optimized a function that was doing a "country tag lookup" (an internal thing) which was a bottleneck at some moments of gameplay.
- Fixed CTD and by the way the inconsistency between the ordinary AI, and the volunteers AI.
- Lots of memory leaks fixes in general (Leaked memory means that the game consumes more and more RAM over the time).
- Fixed several CTDs in a new division names system.
- Fixed CTDs that occured after loading the older save games.
- Fixed CTD that sometimes happened when going back to main menu.

- Fixed CTD in AI strategy referring to the leaders being deleted by spawning a civil war.
- Fixed invalid access to a deleted memory in the decision status (making very low probability for a CTD).

- Another large performance optimization in the naval unit transportation system.
- Optimized the amount of the network commands spammed by the AI.
- Small optimization in pathfinding for the naval transportation. Units ready to set off from the same location will get only 1 naval pathfind done and share the data.

- Got rid of the several seconds stall on daily updates. Related to the sending/receiving volunteer forces.

- Fixed CTD caused by incorrect re-assignment of the armies between the theatres.

- Fixed rare CTD after deleting defensive line.
- Fixed several Out of Sync bugs in MP.
- Fixed OOS from pinned strat.regions mismatch after hotjoin.

- AI is now MUCH better at looking at the equipment cost for switching more templates than just one at a time
- AI cares about infrastructure way more when placing consctruction
- AI should no longer go as happy on naval construction over military (was counting ratio also using civilian so got disproportional large naval part)
- AI us now allowed to trade using more civilian factories
