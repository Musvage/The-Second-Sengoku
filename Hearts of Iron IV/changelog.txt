# Feature
##################################
- Convoy and mine missions will work with islands of regions now. The fleet will be distributed in between disconnected groups of regions and each task force will be only able to do missions within the connected regions to which it is assigned.
- Added an explanatory event to the naval treaty system that informs countries not at war that they are no longer bound by the Naval Treaty if two other majors are at war.
- Changed how naval supremacy is being calculated. Now it depends on the size of the ships in the task force, and how effective it is on a region. A fleet that is assigned more regions than it can handle will get lower supremacies. Mission type also affects supremacy of a fleet.

# Stability & Performance
##################################
- fixed an OOS that is caused by triggering same event twice
- added CTD safety checks to deployment destruction to avoid random crashes
- Prevented using the Continue button to load an old save from a previous and incompatible save version.
- Possibly fixed new game launch crash with modded initial state where it tries to instantly peace out countries at war
- Better handling of error messages from the DirectX function calls (so now if something goes wrong with rendering, we see what is it about).
- Fixed CTD when selecting planes on a non-owned carrier after a civil war.
- Fixed CTD related to the new division names system.
- Fixed CTD in our code responsible for parsing (searching) the folders and files.
- Fixed CTD when using event add_ofssite_building when it would put the building level below zero.

- Added extra safety checks to prevent potential CTDs when joining to a MP session.
- Filtered out superficial unit and country leader values when calculating checksum, to avoid false positive OOS.
- Fixed possible OOS cause when client and host have different sets of leader portraits or names (DLCs and MODs may cause that each player in the session has different portraits/names).

Used probabilistic math to determine overall chance that none of the random checks for interception will pass over the whole path, affected by movement speed since the checks occur hourly, and subtract that from 100% to get chance of interception.
- Fixed naval supply paths to correctly take into account actual versus needed convoy counts when determining convoy efficiency.

- Med various code safer to avoid theoretically possible but improbable crashes.
- Fixed a resource leak of the ambient battle sound which also led to heavy audio falloff computations after a long time of watching battles closely. Sound effect instances were being stopped but never destroyed.
- Added an error and prevented a crash if a supply area is missing
- Fixed crash when loading a savegame while in a peace conference
- Fixed crash when adding manpower to casualties when the killer was not at war with the owner of the manpower ( for instance volunteers ), casualties will now be added to the logicalcountry of the army in such situations
- Fixed memory leak due to old messages piling up over time that were never used
- Optimized the amount of calculations related to front systems (base mechanics required by the battleplans) used by the volunteers battleplans.
- Optimized a function that was doing a "country tag lookup" (an internal thing) which was a bottleneck at some moments of gameplay.
- Fixed CTD and by the way the inconsistency between the ordinary AI, and the volunteers AI.
- Lots of memory leaks fixes in general (Leaked memory means that the game consumes more and more RAM over the time).

- Another large performance optimization in the naval unit transportation system.
- Optimized the amount of the network commands spammed by the AI.

- Fixed CTD caused by incorrect re-assignment of the armies between the theatres.

- AI is now MUCH better at looking at the equipment cost for switching more templates than just one at a time 
- AI cares about infrastructure way more when placing consctruction
- AI should no longer go as happy on naval construction over military (was counting ratio also using civilian so got disproportional large naval part)
- AI us now allowed to trade using more civilian factories
