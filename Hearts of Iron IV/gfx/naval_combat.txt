# information about the ship assets
# For the naval_formation scene, the node named "root" is where the capital ship will be placed, there should also be at least 3 nodes named "l_position_1", "l_position_2" etc, and "r_position_1", "r_position_2" etc
# these will be used to randomly place support ships around the capital ship

# For the naval_combat_formation, there are 4 types of nodes. "defend_position_big_X" (where X is a number 1-9), "defend_position_small_X", "attack_position_big_X", "attack_position_small_X". Capital ships
# will be placed at the xxx_big_X positions depending on if it is attacking or defending, support ships will be placed in the xxx_small_X positions. There should be at least 1 big and 3 small positions for each side.

# The ships themselves should have nodes named "hit_effect_locator1", "hit_effect_locator2" etc, and "miss_effect_locator1", "miss_effect_locator2" etc where the hit and miss effects will be played when ship is hit/missed
