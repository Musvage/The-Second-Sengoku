# Associates equipment archetypes and/or types with a GFX entry or a dds file.
#
# Valid root keys are "default", a continent name or a country tag. Root containers may contain keys with a name
# corresponding to an equipment type or archetype.
# Type containers can contain any number of "pool" collections which can define a "limit" trigger, a sort "weight",
# an "icons" array containing GFX names and/or dds file paths, and a "models" array containing 3D entity names.
#
# If pools have the same weight, e.g. the default weight of 1:
# - Type and archetype is sorted higher than family type and family archetype.
# - If defined in different scopes, country is sorted higher than continent which is sorted higher than "default".
# - If defined in the same scope, equipment type definitions are sorted higher than equipment archetype definitions.
# - If all else is equal, the order of definition in this file determines sort order, with later definitions sorted
#   higher than earlier definitions.
#
# Icons within the same pool are sorted low to high, i.e. they will be displayed in reverse order in the in-game UI.
#
# Please note that if the database is split up into multiple files their alphabetical order will determine the order in
# which they are read and as a result pool definition order.
#
# The final icon set for an equipment type sorted high to low with all pool weights being equal will then contain:
# 1.  Country-specific icons for type
# 2.  Country-specific icons for archetype
# 3.  Continent-specific icons for type
# 4.  Continent-specific icons for archetype
# 5.  Generic icons for type
# 6.  Generic icons for archetype
# 7.  Country-specific icons for type family
# 8.  Country-specific icons for archetype family
# 9.  Continent-specific icons for type family
# 10. Continent-specific icons for archetype family
# 11. Generic icons for type family
# 12. Generic icons for archetype family

# The comment on each line with either the file path or GFX entry is not needed and only there to ease testing during
# development.
