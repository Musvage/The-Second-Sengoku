 submarine_1:0 "Kaichu Class"
 submarine_1_desc:0 "The kaichu class submarines were built after WWI and based on the earlier submarines. These medium-sized submarines were adequately armed, possesses good operational range and had good speed for their time, but by 1938 they were somewhat outdated. Altogether 42 Kaichu type submarines were built for the IJN and the series included 7 variants."
 #submarine_1b: "Kaidai III Class"
 submarine_2:0 "Kaidai VI Class"
 submarine_2_desc:0 "The Kaidai VI class submarines were large and well-armed submarines with long range and relatively good speed. The entire Kaidai series of submarines were stable and successful boats which served the IJN until the Pacific War ended."
 submarine_3:0 "Ko/Otsu/Hei-gata Class"
 submarine_3_desc:0 "The Ko-gata, Otsu-gata, and Hei-gata class boats were large-sized cruiser submarines which served as command ships for submarine squadrons. They were equipped with sophisticated radio equipment, heavy torpedo armament and their larger sizes meant a large operational radius. The Ko and Otsu-gata classes carried float-planes as well for scouting role."
 #submarine_3b: "Ko/Otsu/Hei-gata Class (late)"
 submarine_4:0 "Sen-Toku Class"
 submarine_4_desc:0 "The Sen-Toku class submarines were the largest submersibles of WWII. They were submarine aircraft carriers with heavy torpedo armament, adequate light AA and, due to their size and engines, relatively fast and long-ranged. They were able to carry three Aichi M6A Seiran aircraft for scouting and limited striking abilities."
 #submarine_4b: "Sen-Taka Class"
 destroyer_1:0 "Minekaze Class"
 destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Minekaze, Kamikaze, and Mutsuki class destroyers were well-armed both with surface guns and torpedoes for their time but had limited AA weaponry. They were considered obsolete at the start of WWII and relegated to mostly secondary roles."
 #destroyer_1b: "Fubuki Class"
 destroyer_2:0 "Asashio Class"
 destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Asashio class destroyers was the first Japanese destroyer class to exceed 2,000 tons displacement and the first to be equipped with sonar. They had heavy torpedo weaponry and adequate light AA guns, and a slightly larger operational radius than the older Fubuki class."
 #destroyer_2b_ "Kagero Class"
 destroyer_3:0 "Akizuki Class"
 destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Akizuki class destroyers were well-armed with both surface guns and torpedoes, adequate AA armament, as well as much needed extra depth charges. Out of the 39 planned only 12 were completed before the series was cancelled."
 destroyer_4:0 "Shimakaze Class"
 destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Shimakaze class was the fastest destroyer in the world at the time of its completion. It was a prototype destroyer to test out new high-temperature, high-pressure turbines. It was extremely fast and heavily armed with torpedoes, but this meant a smaller radius of operations."
 light_cruiser_1:0 "Tenryu Class"
 light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Tenryu class ships displaced around 4,400 tons and were lightly armed compared to the similar vessels of other navies, but good speed and adequate torpedo armament made up for these shortcomings. They were designed to act as flagships for destroyer flotillas, and thus considered an intermediate class between the light cruiser and the destroyer."
 #light_cruiser_1b: "Kuma Class"
 #light_cruiser_1c: "Sendai Class"
 light_cruiser_2:0 "Light Mogami Class"
 light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Mogami class cruisers were heavily armed, equipped with good armor and strong engines that provided high speed. They were up-gunned from their original design and reclassified as heavy cruisers. The good AA defense and high speed ensured a long range of operations."
 light_cruiser_3:0 "Agano Class"
 light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Agano-class light cruisers were designed primarily as flottila leaders for destroyer squadrons. They were fast, armed with 3 twin 152mm guns, but limited AA armaments and thin armor plates were major drawbacks of the design."
 #light_cruiser_3b: "Oyodo Class"
 light_cruiser_4:0 "Agatsuma Class"
 light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Agatsuma class was light cruiser class that never saw any ships built before the end of the war. The cruisers were designed to be fast and heavily armed but light-armored, to protect the fleets and carriers against enemy aircraft."
 heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Furutaka Class"
 heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Furutaka-class and the following Aoba class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the Imperial Japanese Navy. They were designed the US Omaha and British Hawkins class as templates. Later in their life they were modernized and received new armaments and better engines."
 #heavy_cruiser_1b: "Myoko Class"
 heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Heavy Mogami Class"
 heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The heavy Mogami class was an up-gunned and reclassified light cruiser class. This made them fast, heavily armed and well-armored cruisers. Their long range came at the cost of, thinner armor protection."
 heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Tone Class"
 heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Tone class heavy cruisers were originally designed as light cruisers, but revisioned with heavier armaments. They were unique in that all armaments were positioned forward, while the aft part of the ship was used to carry and service float-planes that scouted for enemy forces."
 heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Ibuki Class"
 heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Ibuki-class heavy cruisers were the last cruisers to be built by Japan before the end of the war. They were improved versions of the Mogami class heavy cruisers, featuring the same layout and armament but with more modern AA weaponry and engines."
 battle_cruiser_1:0 "Amagi Class"
 battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Amagi battlecruisers were a series of planned battlecruisers as part of the Japanese Navy's ambitious plan to have eight battleships and eight battlecruisers. Following the Washington Naval Treaty, the Amagi ships were scrapped, and one converted to a carrier."
 battle_cruiser_2:0 "Design B-65"
 battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Design B-65 battlecruisers were fast, moderately armored vessels with good AA weaponry and modern armaments. Designed to fight the new heavy cruisers of the US Navy and to protect the fleet carriers of the IJN, the ships would have been a force to be reckoned with if finished."
 battleship_1:0 "Fuso Class"
 battleship_1_desc:0 "The Fuso class battleships were built during WWI and modernized in the 1930's when the 1st London Naval Treaty banned construction of new battleships for the signatories. They were well-armored and armed, with the 6 twin turrets on the centerline giving a heavy broadside, but also limiting the extra AA weaponry these ships could carry."
 #battleship_1b: "Ise Class" (refit version)
 #battleship_1c: "Nagato Class" (refit version)
 battleship_2:0 "Kongo Class"
 battleship_2_desc:0 "The Kongo battleships were built for the IJN just before World War I as battlecruisers, but were heavily modernized in the late 1930s and reclassified as first rate fast battleships. Their armor, guns and engines were all drastically upgraded and the Kongos emerged as the fastest Japanese battleships of the war."
 battleship_3:0 "Tajima Class"
 battleship_3_desc:0 "The Tajima class was a hypothetical class of fast battleships, designed to be cheaper and faster to build than the massive Yamato class battleships. They utilized the older cannons of previous battleships, but high speed, adequate armor and AA provided the defense for these ships."
 battleship_4:0 "Iwami Class"
 battleship_4_desc:0 "The Iwami class was a hypothetical class of battleships, that utilized new methods to speed up construction. They were well-armed with new cannons and heavy AA guns, and could match any similarly armed vessels for firepower. However, the resulting improvements meant a heavier and thus somewhat slower class of ships."
 SH_battleship_1:0 "Yamato Class"
 SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Yamato class consisted of the heaviest battleships ever created, displacing 72,000 tons, and the ships were designed to be the pride and might of the Japanese navy under the Peace Goddesses plan. Each ship carried nine 460-millimetre naval guns, the largest naval artillery ever fitted to a warship."
 SH_battleship_2:0 "Super Yamato Class"
 SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The hypothetical Super Yamato class saw the Yamato was used as a base, but the weapons would be even stronger with a main armament of 51cm cannons and a strong AA armament of the newest type. Their armor thickness was designed to withstand even shells from its own cannons, and they would displace around 70-80.000tons."
 carrier_1:0 "Kaga Class"
 carrier_1_desc:0 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was Japan's first fleet carrier. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier. This resulted in a large and heavily armored carrier with limited space for improvement. However, it was an important experience in aircraft carrier construction for the Imperial Japanese Navy."
 #carrier_1b: "Akagi Class" (refit Kaga class)
 carrier_2:0 "Soryu Class"
 carrier_2_desc:0 "Soryu and Hiryu were designed with mirrored island superstructure to speed up aircraft recovery processes while sailing next to each other. They were fast carriers with room for large air groups, but minimally armored. They displaced 20.000tons and large engines provided high speed and a long range of operations."
 #carrier_2b: "Hiryu Class"
 carrier_3:0 "Shokaku Class"
 carrier_3_desc:0 "The Shokaku class aircraft carriers were designed for high speed, long radius of action, heavy protection and a large aircraft capacity, which made them excellent carriers. Due to the improved construction methods, they displaced 33.000tons full load, and could survive more damage than most contemporary carriers."
 #carrier_3b: "Hiyo Class"
 carrier_4:0 "Taiho Class"
 carrier_4_desc:0 "The Taiho class aircraft carrier was the IJN's first fully armored carriers, with an armored flight deck to withstand multiple bomb and torpedo hits and still function effectively. A large air group together AND heavy AA armament would provide not just self-defense but also force projection over enemy forces."
