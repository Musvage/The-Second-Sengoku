 POLITICS_GREW_DESC:0 "An experienced diplomat, having served as ambassador for America in a variety of countries, Grew effectively acts as governor to America’s Naval Base and territory at Chiba. Acting as the voice of the United States advising and pressuring policy changes within the Japanese Republic, whom the Americans have historically propped up, Joseph Grew is both loyal to his country and concerned with Japan’s current path. Worried that current American meddling over Japanese democracy is strengthening the cause of those who seek to destroy America’s creation outright, Joseph is more open than most other Western governors in Japan to the prospect of weakening their clutch over Japan."

 POLITICS_HATA_DESC:0 "The successor to Kazushige Ugaki, Hata now commands as a warlord of warlords. The very existence of his state is borne out of the armies confidence in their right to govern Japan as a principled and uncorrupted force. Yet the years of stagnation by the military machine in the South has rapidly degraded the internal strength of the Republic’s old army. Hata is a warlord trying to bring order to a government of other warlords An impossible task. Whether Hata’s conviction will see him through or his leadership shall fall to the ambitions of those he commands remains to be seen."

#Republic of Ezo
 POLITICS_KATAYAMA_DESC:0 "The Social-Democratic Leader of the Ezo Republic, Tetsu has come to rule Ezo as a comfortable bridge between the winds of socialist change that swept through the Japanese Republic in 1930 and continued respect for the old democratic system prior to the July Crisis. While not at regular odds with the politics of the Tokyo government, President Katayama has continued to serve as one of the few regime leaders in Japan prepared to reconcile and cooperate with the Republic."

 POLITICS_GRAEFF_DESC:0 "Descending from one of the Netherland’s most influential merchant families from the old Golden Days, De Graeff was once the Governor for the Dutch East Indies. Now assigned to the management of the Dutch governorate in Hirado, which the Netherlands seized less than five years before the total collapse of the Republic. A staunch supporter of benevolent colonialism, De Graeff’s main priorities are to win the hearts and minds of Dutch Hirado and to promote a mediated reunification of Japan."

#Imperial State of Kansai
 POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "Emperor Showa has returned to the home of his ancient family. Decades of exile in the United Kingdom since the end of the Boshin War have come to an end. Since being smuggled back into the country with British backing via Osaka during the crisis in 1930, Emperor Showa has been growing ever more successful in his path to restoration. Once limited to little more than Kyoto, Hirohito’s cause has led to expansion through conquest and municipal defections alike. The history, promises and cause of the Monarchy have left few across the islands to outright despise the Young Emperor. But decades of Republican and Shogunate rule, combined with the reactionary cause that the imperial family backed during the Boshin War, has left Japan disillusioned with the perfection of monarchy. To many Hirohito is just another, albeit honourable, tyrant in this age of division."
#French Kobe
 POLITICS_CATROUX_DESC:0 "Unlike the other European territory leaders, Georges Catroux is not primarily a diplomat. Instead, Catroux is first and foremost a general. Assigned to the effectively French-controlled sphere over Kobe, General Catroux’s main task and responsibility has firstly been to cement French military control over the city following the breakdown of Japan; secondly to actually govern it. Catroux would sooner die than relinquish Kobe to an invader without direct orders from his government. But with war looming on the home continent, is there any Catroux can do to stop such an event with a skeleton garrison to man the city?"
#Kyushu Navy Junta
 POLITICS_YAMAMOTO_DESC:0 "The “Emperor of the Admiralty”, Isoroku Yammamoto rose to power following the outbreak of the July crisis. In which his actions by starting the Kyushu Naval Mutiny, ordering the forces under his command to establish maritime control over the island, triggered the establishment of the Naval Junta. Relatively more stable and moderately-minded than his counterparts in the army junta, Yamamoto is keen to protect his beloved navy from the hostile army command."

 POLITICS_CRAIGIE_DESC:0 "Sir Robert Leslie Craigie, the current Ambassador to Japan and governor of British-occupied Osaka, is the shrewd diplomat tasked by the UK to navigate the British trade city through these treacherous years of civil war. Craigie understands the precarious and fragile nature of Europe’s hold over their Far Eastern possessions. For that reason, he continues to be a cautious voice in British policy towards Japan. Emphasising the importance of ensuring that the British sway the path of Japan in favour of those governments more prepared to accept Britain’s control over its Osaka territory."

#Japanese Provisional Government
 POLITICS_REIJIRO_DESC:0 "Born into a Samurai family, Wakatsuki has come to represent the standing ideals of the American-established Japanese Republic Peace, cooperation and freedom. As current leader of the coalition within the unstable republic, Wakatsuki is determined to sail the ship of state on a path of maintaining interparty cooperation, bloodless reunification under the Republic and cooperation with the liberal state’s American protectors."

 POLITICS_KENZO_DESC:0 "Committed to his ideals of ultranationalism, order and fascism, Adachi Kenzo has come to be convinced that Japan’s current collapse and crisis has been a result of the corruption of the established order. Having drawn parallels to Japan’s past instability under the Republic to interwar Italy and Germany, Kenzo’s policies have become increasingly similar to European Fascistic politics."
#Tokugawa Shogunate
 POLITICS_IESATO_DESC:0 "Unknown throughout the Republican Era. Iesato was jettisoned into the theater of leadership amidst the 1930 July Crisis. With the isles in chaos, the Samurai aristocracy of central Japan hastily established their conservative rule in the region out of desperate preservation as violent communist uprisings swept across the corrupted republic. Their immediate choice was Tokugawa Iesato, the old shogun before their defeat during The Great War. Now the representative and protector of this ancient aristocracy, Iesato cannot afford to be known as the ruler to destroy the Shogunate twice."

 POLITICS_NOSAKA_DESC:0 "Calm, respectful and thoughtful. Sanzo Nosaka does not readily fit the stereotype of the fervorous and violent communist leader. Born to a wealthy merchant family, Sanzo’s entry into Marxist circles has brought about respect from many avenues of Communist thought. Committed to the standing policy of cooperation between the countless interpretations and agencies of the Japanese Communist movement, Sanzo has thus far prevented internal collapse and disunity but at the price of a clear direction. His more modest, reformist ideals have also left many to hold him responsible for the Communist uprising’s inability to take control over the entire country early into the Liberal Republic’s collapse. While relatively respected by those outside the movement, this growing popular dissatisfaction internally may stop even Nosaka from holding the communist groups together."
