  SHO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Tokugawa Shogunate has been restored to the central Japan. The collapse of order in the Japanese Republic in 1930 left Japan in anarchy. The Shogunate has since been restored to central Japan with the support of the traditionalists in the area. The Shogunate aims to provide a pretender government that certainly shows no military weakness. Fueled by increasingly popular propaganda about the ancient samurai, the local populace is militarising and prepared to take the Shogun’s warpath to the reunification of Japan."
