  SHO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Tokugawa Shogunate has been restored to the central Japanese countrysides. The collapse of order in the Japanese Republic following a series of left-wing protest actions and unpermitted declarations of martial law by the military revealed the inability of the Japanese Republic to secure their lands. Since then, the Shogunate has been restored in central Japan with the support of the traditionalist clans their and a collection of conservative politicians of the republic. The Shogunate aims to provide a pretender government that certainly shows no military weakness, but is not purely a warlord state. Fueled by increasingly popular propaganda about the ancient samurai, the local populace is militarising and prepared to take the Shogun’s warpath to the reunification of Japan."
