 PRO_fortify_tohoku_border:0 "Fortify Tohoku Border"
 PRO_fortify_tohoku_border_desc:0 "The barbarians that occupy Tohoku are now better than the hordes that tried to invade our islands so many centuries ago.

 PRO_reform_our_economy:0 "Reform our Economy"
 PRO_reform_our_economy_desc:0 "Japan’s current free-market government leaves too much power in the hands of private businesses; something which has antagonized the working class to turn-coating for the reds. By shifting towards a mixed-market economy we can help to alleviate this social tension."

 PRO_war_plan_black_desc:0 "The Fascists from Shikoku are an affront to everything we stand for.

While those to the West might believe that their elites are enlightened and those to the East believe the underclass are all good and honest, we know better, anyone can be capable of good or evil no matter their status. Thus none are above the law."

 PRO_unity:0 "Unity"
 PRO_unity_desc:0 "The Republic, before the Military declaring Martial Law and sending us into collapse, kept Japan at peace for over a decade.

 PRO_declaration_of_martial_law:0 "Tokyo in Chaos"
 PRO_declaration_of_martial_law_desc:0 "The Prime Minister has been killed and what little remains of our democracy is now in anarchy. With extremists now impetuously strolling through the streets of Tokyo and government buildings being bombed regularly, the Tokyo police have taken urgent action by shutting down the civil government and putting the entire country under the authority of the Police, combined with the countryside cooperation of the army."
 PRO_expand_policeforces:0 "Expand Police Forces"
 PRO_expand_policeforces_desc:0 "By reducing the training curriculum and increasing the size of our police force we could quite literally get a policeman on every street corner.

 PRO_deal_with_america:0 "Deal with America"
 PRO_deal_with_america_desc:0 "The Americans have been quite patient with us. It was during the months of constant cabinet collapses that the Americans pressured us to restabilize. It was them too who deployed their military forces from their Chiba Naval Station to prevent Tokyo from collapsing into the chaos. Let us forge a renewed partnership with the Americans as we prepare to resist the coming storm."
 PRO_deal_with_the_british:0 "Deal with the British"
 PRO_deal_with_the_british_desc:0 "Britain is a nation of shopkeepers, and like any shopkeeper, they know a good deal when they see one. Arranging a trade arrangement with their government would give us a better chance at withstanding the Communists and Fascists, and the last thing they would want right now is an Asian power under an unfriendly government."
 PRO_kanto_militia:0 "Kanto Militia"
 PRO_kanto_militia_desc:0 "Kanto is the last bastion of hope for the sane peoples of Japan. Forming paramilitary divisions could prove useful in ensuring the defence of our coastlines, control of occupied territories or could be put towards supplementing our main forces."

 PRO_urbanise_tokyo_bay_desc:0 "Tokyo is a coastal city. But much of the city is spreading inland.

 PRO_synthetic_refinery_production:0 "Synthetic Refinery Production"
 PRO_synthetic_refinery_production_desc:0 "The Germans in Europe, in their struggles to achieve autarky, have made great endeavours in the fields of synthetic refinement of key strategic resources. By following their example and likewise endeavouring to innovate this field of research, we may help to mitigate Japan’s lack of vital resources to future war efforts."
 PRO_neutrality_act:0 "Neutrality Act"
 PRO_neutrality_act_desc:0 "Japan is ours, morally and legally. But we will not join in on the intrigue and web-building that the self-proclaimed governments engage in. Instead, we will assert Japan’s official neutrality in foreign affairs abroad, following the example of our America protectors. We will likewise commit this policy internally to handling the warlords that have seized our countryside. By keeping our hands clean and never taking the path of aggression, our American brothers will feel much greater moral and political obligation to lend us their support when the warlords finally charge towards us."
 PRO_nationalize:0 "Nationalize"
 PRO_nationalize_desc:0 "Certain industries and sectors belong outside of the control of private enterprises. By putting such elements as healthcare services under ministerial control, we can ensure those services are not dictated by the bottom line."

 PRO_invest_in_inner_kanto:0 "Invest in Inner Kanto"
 PRO_invest_in_inner_kanto_desc:0 "Investment and development schemes in the urban environs of Kanto will increase the rate of urbanisation and industrialisation for our people to the cities.

 PRO_contact_north_japan:0 "Contact North Japan"
 PRO_contact_north_japan_desc:0 "Northern Japan was once a bubbling pot filled with isolated socialist communes, pockets of military warlords and loyalists for numerous other factions. Now it has been engulfed by the left who have won the hearts and minds of the urbanites and ruralists alike. No matter how we feel about them or their ways, we owe it to our people to at least open a channel of communication and dialogue with our foes to the North."
 PRO_contact_south_japan:0 "Contact South Japan"
 PRO_contact_south_japan_desc:0 "South Japan has and continues to be, a land filled with warring factions of the right. The fascists are run Shikoku like a mob family with a personal kingdom. The army and admiralty battle over the Kanmon Straits like children while the Imperials and Shogunate are little better. While it might’ve been the military’s declaration of martial law that caused this entire collapse, we may find unlikely partners among those dictators and elitists to the South."
 PRO_inward_perfection:0 "Inward Perfection"
 PRO_inward_perfection_desc:0 "If we are to effectively govern the rest of the country, we must first overcome what caused us to collapse.

 PRO_heart_of_japan:0 "Heart of Japan"
 PRO_heart_of_japan_desc:0 "Tokyo is the heart of Japan, and despite everything that the world has thrown at it, it still survives. As long as Tokyo remains free and under the freedom of the Republic, the dream of liberty and happiness for the Japanese people shall never die. The heart of Japan might have stopped for a mere moment, but now it beats once again, and now we will not rest until it is pumping the blood of freedom and liberty to every corner of these isles."
 PRO_propose_reunion:0 "Propose Reunion"
 PRO_propose_reunion_desc:0 "Ezo has, for years now, been a practically independent force from the Tokyo Government.

 PRO_1936_elections_desc:0 "Japan is fractured, with little more than Tokyo in our grasp. But we will not throw away our democratic way of life. The people deserve to dictate what group shall carve their future for themselves. Not through armed minority groups launching uprisings through the country; by a simple ballot paper and the campaign trail."
 PRO_the_sun_settels:0 "The Sun Settles"
 PRO_the_sun_settels_desc:0 "Winning this war will not be determined by rashness. We will sit this war out. By biding our time, building our friendship with America and allowing the war to come to us, we will garner the support of the international world when this conflict begins."

 PRO_the_sun_rises_desc:0 "The Republic is back once more. Rejuvenated and reinvigorated, we will let no one stand in the way of the right of the people. No fascists, nor communist, nor any petty general shall stand in our march towards ultimate victory. Japan shall be reborn once more!"

 PRO_encourage_lobbying_desc:0 "Lobbying may favour corruption and big business, but it also greatly hones the strength and cooperation between the corporate and political world.

 PRO_recover_from_the_braindrain_desc:0 "The chaos of Tokyo and the collapse of the Provisional Government left much of the Intelligentsia packing for either the opportunities of the rebel factions or leaving for foreign countries.

 PRO_lease_chiba:0 "Lease Chiba"
 PRO_lease_chiba_desc:0 "Since the Entente launched an expedition to end the decrepit and unpopular Shogunate during the last months of the Great War, Chiba has been an American territory under our suzerainty. Our government is the only natural friend of the United States in Japan. The American government will understand that it is essential now more than ever that we have the funds to sustain our projects. By establishing a new lease deal in exchange for continued American control of Chiba, the Americans can subsidise our government without the Roosevelt Administration causing a stir in Congress. It’s a win-win!"

 ### EVENTS
 pro.1.t:0 "Assassination Attempt On the Prime Minister!"
 pro.1.desc:0 "Wakatsuki Reijiro, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government, has been shot by a lone gunman while holding a speech in public! The gunman was soon detained by the police, and the Prime Minister has been rushed to the hospital. This comes at a turbulent time just before the 1936 elections was due to happen, which may very well lead to its cancellation. His condition is currently critical, but there may be hopes of his recovery."

 pro.101.b:0 "The Social Democrats secure a victory in the election!"

 pro.15.desc:0 "It came to our attention that Saburo Arasaka, who was recently employed by our government as theoretician and scientific advisor, is far more skilled than we initially thought. His family owns some business in the fields of electronics, but they are yet modest enterprises. Maybe it would be a good idea to subsidize some of their activities and see where Saburo Arasaka will guide them."
 pro.15.a:0 "We will subsidize Arasaka's businesses."
