 # FOCUSES
  HIR_NAV_neutrality:0 "Domestic Priorities"
  HIR_NAV_neutrality_desc:0 "International relations demand constant attention and light domestic quarrels at home - perhaps, the best policy at the moment is to focus inward and respond to the circumstances rather than trying to shape them."
  HIR_NAV_active_diplomacy:0 "Active Diplomacy"
  HIR_NAV_active_diplomacy_desc:0 "Isolation seldom translates into independence: by not engaging with the world, others will fill the spaces where we could exert influence. This will lead, and most certainly so, to the growth of foreign powers at the expanse of ours."
  HIR_NAV_aggressive:0 "Aggressive Stance"
  HIR_NAV_aggressive_desc:0 "Actions speak louder than words, and we will take measures to secure our independence and our sphere of influence, even at the cost of upsetting uncooperative neighbours."
  HIR_NAV_befriend_PRT:0 "Overtures to Nagasaki"
  HIR_NAV_befriend_PRT_desc:0 "Nagasaki, controlled by the Portuguese, could be a strategic partner in Eastern Asia. We must make the correct diplomatic overtures to bring them to our side."
  HIR_NAV_befriend_KYU:0 "Overtures to Kyushu"
  HIR_NAV_befriend_KYU_desc:0 "Kyushu, a Japanese rump state, could be a strategic partner in Eastern Asia. We must make the correct diplomatic overtures to bring them to our side."
  HIR_NAV_befriend_KYU_2:0 "Trade Concessions to [KYU.GetNonIdeologyName]"
  HIR_NAV_befriend_KYU_2_desc:0 "Kyushu lacks many raw materials required by its industries. We can negotiate a deal to facilitate their access to our markets - and all resources from our vast colonial empire - in exchange of some of their territory."
  HIR_crisis_self_rule:0 "Increased Colonial Autonomy"
  HIR_crisis_self_rule_desc:0 "To address the chaotic situation in Hirado, local authorities will have their autonomy increased. They, after all, have better and more updated information than ministers back in Amsterdam, and will be able to deal with problems swiftly as they appear."
  HIR_crisis_help:0 "Provide Direct Assistance"
  HIR_crisis_help_desc:0 "To address the poor living conditions of most natives in Hirado, Amsterdam will provide direct assistance in the form of food, supplies and funds to alleviate the situation."
  HIR_crisis_repression:0 "Expand Security Forces"
  HIR_crisis_repression_desc:0 "To address the discontent and disorder in Hirado, Amsterdam will reinforce its police forces. It includes more equipment, funds and, most importantly, broader powers to more expeditely deal with trouble makers."

  HIR_focus_colonial_development:0 "Prioritize Colonial Development"

  HIR_trade_with_all:0 "Free Trade Policy"
  HIR_trade_with_all_desc:0 "The history of the Netherlands is a history of merchants, who brought wealth and power. We will continue this history, welcoming all trade partners regardless of their ideology or opinions, and our policy shall be that of \"laissez faire, laissez passer\"."
  HIR_reafirm_european_neutrality:0 "Reafirm Neutrality in Europe"
  HIR_reafirm_european_neutrality_desc:0 "The Netherlands did not partake in the madness that was the Great War, with its millions of dead. If Europe descends into that hell again, Amsterdam will do anything to spare its people from destruction - anything short of surrendering to a foreign invasion."
  HIR_create_voc:0 "V.O.C."
  HIR_create_voc_desc:0 "The \"Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie\" was essentially its own soverign State, and the backbone of the Dutch colonial empire since the 17th century, until it went bankrupt in 1799. But the \"regular\" administration did not fair much better, and some officials believe that the creation of a new chartered company to take over much of the colonial affairs could be both efficient and profitable."
  HIR_allow_migration:0 "European Transmigration"
  HIR_allow_migration_desc:0 "\"No man is an island, entire of itself, every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less.\"\n\nEvery time Europe shakes, refugees are washed away to distant lands. And Europe shook a lot lately."
  HIR_sell_land:0 "Allow Purchase of Property"
  HIR_sell_land_desc:0 "If we loosen legislation regarding the purchase of real state and investments by foreign citizens - and there is quite a few of them here now - the whole economy will benefit."
  HIR_integration_policy:0 "Integrate the Newcomers"
  HIR_integration_policy_desc:0 "Migrants from Europe cannot be left on their own: we will strive to accommodate with facilities for new arrivals, translators and a program to settle them in suitable locations."
  HIR_end_crisis:0 "Conciliatory Solutions"
  HIR_end_crisis_desc:0 "Measures to reassert law and order, economic growth and civilized co-existance of natives, older Dutch settlers and newly-arrived Europeans helped overcome the general malaise that afflicted the East Indies, Hirado most of all."
  HIR_labour_mobilization:0 "Labour Mobilization Effort"
  HIR_labour_mobilization_desc:0 "High unemployment in Hirado means that there is an unsed surplus of labor. We must enact a program to put them to work, which will defuse social tensions and benefit the administration."
  HIR_military_infrastructure:0 "Invest in Military Infrastructure"
  HIR_military_infrastructure_desc:0 "With tensions rising worldwide, we could direct our employment program towards the construction of much needed military infrastructure."
  HIR_technical_education:0 "Technische Universiteit Japan"
  HIR_technical_education_desc:0 "The oldest and largest Dutch public technical university is located in Delft, in South Holland. We should create a learning institution modelled after the Technische Universiteit Delft in the East, to qualify the local labour force and increase productivity of the colonies."
  HIR_employment_focus:0 "Full Employment Policy"
  HIR_employment_focus_desc:0 "Our employment program was a success, putting Hirado on the path of recovery from the state of social malaise. We must expand it and assure that unemployment is kept at a minimum and that every native subject to our rule works towards the benefit of the colony."
  HIR_align_england:0 "Side with the Democracies"
  HIR_align_england_desc:0 "The Great War was terrible for many reasons, one of which is that was seen as a pointless war - there were no clear villans or heros. But the last decade saw the rise of undeniable authoritarianism and tyranny, and it is clear that if free countries do not stand together, they will perish alone, one at a time."
  HIR_join_allies:0 "Joint Defence Plan"
  HIR_join_allies_desc:0 "Courageous speeches and pledges of support are of little use without effective and coordinated action. Officers of the highests ranks from the democratic side of Europe will develop a joint defence plan to ensure that, should war happens, they will act as one."
  HIR_fortress_holland:0 "Vesting Holland"
  HIR_fortress_holland_desc:0 "The area north of the great rivers and west of the IJsselmeer encompasses by far the larger part of our population and industry. Sacrificing the rest of the country might allow us to hold out long enough in our industrialized area for a more powerful ally to come to our aid in time."
  HIR_relocate_capital:0 "Relocate Capital to Batavia"
  HIR_relocate_capital_desc:0 "The Netherlands are not like Russia, that can endlessly retreat into a deep territory. If our lines are broken, the enemy would be at the capital in no time. Unless we take the necessary measures to relocate the government to the colonies, much like Portugal did when Napoleon invaded. The lost of the homeland would be a serious blows, but it would not decapitate us."
  HIR_colonial_development_1:0 "Ethische Politiek"
  HIR_colonial_development_1_desc:0 "The \"ethical policy\" was the official policy of the colonial government of the East Indies, assuming responsibility for the welfare of their colonial subjects and emphasising improvement in material living conditions. It suffered, however, from severe underfunding, inflated expectations, and the lack of acceptance in the colonial establishment: the policy must be improved and those issues, addressed."
  HIR_colonial_development_2:0 "Industrialize Colonies"
  HIR_colonial_development_2_desc:0 "The Netherlands have plenty of heavy industries, but transporting their output to the colonies is expensive. Opening new factories to produce cement and steel and other essential materials will enrich the colonial empire."
  HIR_colonial_development_3:0 "Expand Resource Extraction"
  HIR_colonial_development_3_desc:0 "Our colonies still hold untapped wealth beneath the surface. We must invest in more modern mining and processing equipment to fully explore those resources."
  HIR_homeland_development_1:0 "Finish the Zuiderzee Works"
  HIR_homeland_development_1_desc:0 "The Afsluitdijk is the great dam enclosing the Zuiderzee, a salt water inlet of the North Sea. It is part of a larger land reclamation project, which we must strive to finish. It will provide our relatively small coutry more room for industry and agriculture."
  HIR_homeland_development_2:0 "Expand Military Production"
  HIR_homeland_development_2_desc:0 "Relying on import of weapons is a liability: we must expand our domestic military production to secure the means of our defence."
  HIR_homeland_development_3:0 "Develop Naval Industry"
  HIR_homeland_development_3_desc:0 "Trade empires live and die on their capacity to build and repair ships of all sizes and purposes. Investing in our dockyards should be our next priority."
  HIR_homeland_development_z:0 "Collaborate with Plan Z"
  HIR_homeland_development_z_desc:0 "Plan Z was the re-equipment and expansion of Germany's Kriegsmarine enacted in early 1939. The fleet was meant to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. It is unlikely, however, that our allies will be able to finish their great project without our help."
  HIR_land_army_effort:0 "Reform Land Forces"
  HIR_land_army_effort_desc:0 "The Great War redefined warfare in all its forms, and many nations, ours included, tried to modernize their forces in the years following it. But technological and doctrinal developments in the late 20s and early 30s made obsolet many of these reforms, and another broad modernization program for our Army is already a dire need."
  HIR_home_army_effort:0 "Equip Homeland Army"
  HIR_home_army_effort_desc:0 "Our Army needs a substantial rearmament program. Such program will not only improve our fighting capacity, but also help subsidize our defence industry."
  HIR_colony_army_effort:0 "Expand Colonial Armies"
  HIR_colony_army_effort_desc:0 "Our territories are vast and our armed forces are like a blanket too short to cover it all. We must increase conscription of natives and help colonial authorities to equip and train them."
  HIR_focus_tech_artillery:0 "Focus on Artillery"
  HIR_focus_tech_artillery_desc:0 "The French army proved that artillery is the main tool of a modern army. Producing and supplying modern artillery is the essence of industrialized warfare."
  HIR_focus_tech_rifles:0 "Focus on Light Weapons"
  HIR_focus_tech_rifles_desc:0 "Action of the colonies very often happens in difficult terrain with precarious supply lines - our soldiers can rely on little more than the rifle they carry. Therefore, we must sure that they are given the best one possibles."
  HIR_focus_tech_armor:0 "Focus on Armored Vehicles"
  HIR_focus_tech_armor_desc:0 "The final years of the Great War showed how effective armored vehicles can be. Over the last ten years, this technology only improved, with every major power investing in its development. We must follow suit."
  HIR_focus_tech_support:0 "Focus on Support Equipment"
  HIR_focus_tech_support_desc:0 "The frontline is as strong as the long chain of logistics, communications, signaling, engineering and medical battalions."
  HIR_land_army_modernized:0 "Land Forces Modernization"
  HIR_land_army_modernized_desc:0 "Our armies could be considered competent enough to fight in the Great War. But time moved forward, and what was adequate became obsolete, and now we must revise much of our organization, doctrines and tactics to match the lastest developments in land warfare."
  HIR_naval_effort:0 "Reform Naval Forces"
  HIR_naval_effort_desc:0 "Recent years have shown that Army isn't the only branch of the military to undergo a massive strategy change in recent years. New vessels, new tactics, new dangers and new opportunities. In order to adapt to the world of rapidly-changing naval warfare, our naval doctrines and customs will have to undergo a massive revision."
  HIR_naval_tech_submarine:0 "Focus on Submarine Warfare"
  HIR_naval_tech_submarine_desc:0 "The idea of a submarine was theorised quite a long time ago, but only after the Great War it became on of most important tenets on which naval policy of many great powers rely. The Netherlands cannot lay behind behind other nations: we will allocate major government funds to develop new models of submarines to ensure our dominance under water."
  HIR_naval_tech_anti_sub:0 "Focus on Escort Vessels"
  HIR_naval_tech_anti_sub_desc:0 "There are many dangers to martime trade and military transportation, much like there are threats to an infantry battalion moving through an open field.  For that reason, we must have to ensure that our transport vessels are protected by armed ships, capable of deterring any threat. Hostile submarines are going to tremble at sight of our ships, not the other way around! "
  HIR_naval_tech_capital:0 "Focus on Capital Ships"
  HIR_naval_tech_capital_desc:0 "Some in our naval high command might decry our decision as irrational and irresponsible, citing the high costs of developing and building larger and more formidable types of vessels, but battleships and aircraft carriers shall be developed more intensively than ever, lest we let our enemies dominate us in our own waters!"
  HIR_naval_marines:0 "Modernize the Korps Mariniers"
  HIR_naval_marines_desc:0 "The government has ordered the expansion of the Marine Corps. These thoroughly trained troops will be capable of conducting amphibious operations on foreign soil, taking control over vital infrastructure before the arrival of our main forces."
  HIR_amphibious_invasion_effort:0 "Improve Amphibious Operations"
  HIR_amphibious_invasion_effort_desc:0 "As unfortunate as it might be, our climate and geography are wastly different from that of our colonies. Our tactics, both offensive and defensive, cannot be simply utilised oceans away. In order to ensure combat efficiency and tactical coherence of our troops during a naval invasion of any kind, we must develop new strategies and plans, suited for all types of environment."
  HIR_navy_modernized:0 "Naval Forces Modernization"
  HIR_navy_modernized_desc:0 "We have managed to greatly change our understanding of naval warfare, develop new kinds of vessels and create a more organic connection between land and naval forces. But only fool would rest on his laurels: we will continue to develop and perfect our naval forces, and the foundations we have laid will help us to achieve that!"
  HIR_air_force_effort:0 "Reform Air Forces"
  HIR_air_force_effort_desc:0 "Applications of military aircraft have changed drastically over the years. New, hitherto unexplored ways of engaging in aerial combat have been theorised all over the world. For too long, we ignored these developements: our air forces will have to undergo a series of reforms and equipment updates to meet the ever-growing standards of aerial combat."
  HIR_air_tech_fighter:0 "Focus on Fighters"
  HIR_air_tech_fighter_desc:0 "In the early 20th century, the dominant type of light aircraft were the biplanes, developed primarily for reconnaissance purposes. By the end of the Great War, the reality of conventional warfare had changed drastically. Now, it is more important than ever to develop proper fighting planes, capable of engaging in head-on battles with enemy aicraft. "
  HIR_air_tech_nav:0 "Focus on Naval Bombers"
  HIR_air_tech_nav_desc:0 "The threat presented by hostile navies to our colonial and mainland possession cannot be underestimated. However, it is unlikely that we'll be able to easily catch up with major powers in terms of raw naval power. For that reason, sevelal high-ranking officers have proposed to fund developement of new kind of bomber aircraft, one designed specifically to assist our navy and destroy the enemy ships."
  HIR_air_tech_cas:0 "Focus on Close Air Support"
  HIR_air_tech_cas_desc:0 "Armored vehicles were decisive in the final stages of the Great War, and many countries tried to develop anti-tank rifles and more expensive artillery pieces. But as aviation technology improved, it became clear that bombers could be effective counters to armored vehicles - and it seems to be the path forward."
  HIR_air_tech_radar:0 "Advanced Electronics Studies"
  HIR_air_tech_radar_desc:0 "There is more to modern warfare than iron and blood. Advanced devices for communication and targetting can make military units far more effective than having a few more barrels pointed at the enemy."
  HIR_air_tech_rocket:0 "Advanced Propulsion Stutides"
  HIR_air_tech_rocket_desc:0 "Rockets are not exactly a new technology, but their use as a propulsion mechanism for advanced aircraft or missles is the new frontier of military technology."
  HIR_air_force_modernized:0 "Air Forces Modernization"
  HIR_air_force_modernized_desc:0 "We have made substantial investments in our air force. We must complete our modernization program with development of state-of-the-art equipment and updated military doctrines for the correct employment of our planes."
  HIR_nationalist_government:0 "Paleis Incident"
  HIR_nationalist_government_desc:0 "Senates and congresses are faceless entities, but a monarchy rests on the shoulder of a single person. If the monarchy does not lead the country to the correct path, it is always easy to point the culprit, and take measures to correct it."
  HIR_monarchist_government:0 "The Queen Abdicates"
  HIR_monarchist_government_desc:0 "Her Majesty belongs to an older era, and the future of the Netherlands demanded new action, new plans, new paths. The illustrious Queen Wilhelmina should abdicate her position to antecipate the ascencion of her daughter, Princess Juliana, to the throne - herself the right person to lead the Netherlands towards a glorious future."
  HIR_join_axis:0 "Pact Amsterdam-Berlijn"
  HIR_join_axis_desc:0 "The future will not be the liberal future, for liberalism clearly failed. It failed the West's economies, it failed international peace keeping, it failed to keep the red menace in check. The future belongs to the strong, and the Netherlands will side of those who understand it."
  HIR_royal_wedding_germany:0 "Preußischer Prinz, Nederlandse Prinses"
  HIR_royal_wedding_germany_desc:0 "Sometimes the traditional solution is the most effective. Instead of barbed wire, trenchs and bunkers, the Netherlands can secure itself against German ambitions by a policy of rapprochement, and the marriage between our two royal families is the best way to achieve that."
  HIR_abandon_lon:0 "Abandon the League of Nations"
  HIR_abandon_lon_desc:0 "The League of Nations was nothing but a liberal daydream, utterly unable to serve its purpose of preserving peace after the Great War. It constrained unilateral action by the victorious powers to stop the rearmanet of the defeated, while doing nothing itself to prevent it. We will withdraw from this organization and guarantee our independence by other means."
  HIR_voc_political_capital:0 "Political Capital"
  HIR_voc_political_capital_desc:0 "Being such a profitable trade partners, we are welcomed at the table of States and conglomerates alike. We can use our commercial contacts as leverage for more complex political maneuvers."
  HIR_voc_refit_ships:0 "Refit Merchant Ships"

  hirado.1.d:0 "In a communiqué issued this morning to the press and foreign embassies, the Dutch government headed by [HIR.GetSecondTitle] [HIR.GetDualLeaderName] has reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to neutrality in European affairs. Citing the devastating losses of the Great War, the official statement emphasized the Netherlands' desire to remain apart from any future continental conflict. "The preservation of peace and the safety of the Dutch people remains our paramount concern," [HIR.GetDualLeaderName]'s statement read.\n\nThe communiqué further clarifyed that while the Netherlands desire peace, they are prepared to defend their borders with the full force of the Dutch military."

  hirado.3.t:0 "Netherlands Join the Allies!"
  hirado.3.d:0 "The Netherlands decided that neutrality in the face of unprovoked aggression was no longer an option, and joined the Allies in their struggle against the German menace.\n\nNow, every able-bodied Dutchman, from the homeland to the colonies, will add to the war effort of the liberal democracies against the forces of tyranny."

  hirado.4.d:0 "The Netherlands finally abandoned their traditional policy of neutrality, signing a treaty for mutual defence with Great Britain and her allies.\n\nThis announcement was made after a strategic plan for mutual defence was devised by a joint commission between the two countries,  presenting the German coalition with a \"fait accompli\". Suddenly a new threat materialized at its border. Is it enough to check Germany's ambitions?"

  hirado.5.d:0 "The Netherlands' position in Europe is not secure. Although plans for defending the borders and the capital exist, changes of standing against Germany without substantial help are slim at best. Therefore, the High Command proposed a bold strategy: in true Portuguese fashion, to relocate the capital to one of our colonies.\n\nAfter serious deliberation, the government approved of that plan, and begun preparations to move the capital to Batavia, Dutch Indies. Whatever is the fate of Amsterdam, the Dutch empire will live to continue the fight."
  hirado.5.self:0 "We are prepared to carry on the fight."

  hirado.6.d:0 "After years of troubled administration and failed economic policies, the Dutch government reinstated the \"Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie\" - the Dutch East Indies Company.\n\nAccording to the rather surprising announcements, the objective is to facilitate the influx of private capital to the colonial empire, specially in the fields of infrastructure and resource extraction, as well as facilitating the administration, free from the difficulties of a liberal democracy.\n\n[HIR.GetLeader] was appointed the new governor-general of the whole Dutch East Indies by the V.O.C., and will carry out its new policies with determination."

  hirado.8.d:0 "The failed liberal experiment loses another member: the Netherlands left the League.\n\nBuilt after the Great War to ensure peace, it is clear that the League of Nations lacks the means to achieve its stated goal. Several conflicts erupted around the world, the League unable to halt them or even to pressure the belligerants in any way. Important members, such as Brazil, already left the League, and now the Netherlands joins the list of former members."

  hirado.9.d:0 "Tragedy has struck the Netherlands: Queen Wilhelmina, daughter of William III and Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, beloved by her people, has been assassinated! She fell victim to a distant rifleman while out in the palace gardens. \n\nFlags will be flown at half-mast in both the homeland and the colonies for the entire week, while the nation deals with the political implications of such an event.\n\nIt is too soon to name the assassin, but far-right politicians wasted no time in accusing the communists, and the press already reports acts of vandalism against unions and CPN buildings. Princess Juliana, now Queen, has been announced as the new head of State and has dismissed the current government on the grounds that it was unable to preserve peace. While elections are being scheduled, she appointed [HIR.GetDualLeaderName] as the new Prime Minister - a radical nationalist, who vowed to restore order and democracy.\n\nSurely, free and fair elections will be scheduled in no time. Surely."

  hirado.10.d:0 "Beloved Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands abdicated the throne in favor of her daughter, Princess Juliana.\n\nThe Dutch monarch was increasingly seen as a relic of an older time, and the responsibilities of her title weighed on her shoulders for too long. The early ascention of her daughter to the throne may invigorate the nation. It is likely that Juliana's recent marriage to the German Prince Louis Ferdinand played a role in this decision, due to its political implications - both internal and external.\n\nWhatever the old Queen's motives were, the new Queen wasted no time in establishing herself as the new head of state and pressuring the government to start a ministerial reform. After a complex dance of chairs in the parliament and the ministry, only committed royalists remained at the head of the government."

  hirado.13.d:0 "After Belgium was overrun by the Axis offensive, Germany transferred its occupation to the Netherlands. The Dutch government seized the opportunity to undo what it considered the biggest blow the country has received in recent history, the loss of this very territory.\n\nThe Belgium government announced \"its withdrawal from the 1830 London Treaty\", which recognized Belgium's independence and set the borders between the two countries. This meant no less than the full annexation of Belgium.\n\nBut this move does more than reinstate the old borders of the Netherlands, since Belgium acquired important territories in Africa, rich in resources, which are now under Dutch control."

However, one important question remain: the scope of our operations, specifically the issue with the Netherlands.

If they commit to our enemies or allow passage throught their territory, it would spell disaster.\n\nThe government in Amsterdam did not commit to one side or another in this conflict, and Berlim is unsure of its true intentions. While relations have been positive so far, the General Staff believes that the Dutch pose a threat that cannot be ignored and recomend that their capitulation should be one of the objectvies of the great offensive against the Allies."

An invasion of the Netherlands, despise how understandable from a strategic standpoint it may be, would be an inexcusable betrayal of our word and would forever damage our reputation."
