 # FOCUSES
  HIR_NAV_neutrality:0 "Domestic Priorities"
  HIR_NAV_neutrality_desc:0 "International relations demand constant attention and light domestic quarrels at home - perhaps, the best policy at the moment is to focus inward and respond to the circumstances rather than trying to shape them."
  HIR_NAV_active_diplomacy:0 "Active Diplomacy"
  HIR_NAV_active_diplomacy_desc:0 "Isolation seldom translates into independence: by not engaging with the world, others will fill the spaces where we could exert influence. This will lead, and most certainly so, to the growth of foreign powers at the expanse of ours."
  HIR_NAV_aggressive:0 "Aggressive Stance"

  HIR_NAV_befriend_KYU_2:0 "Trade Concessions to [KYU.GetNonIdeologyName]"
  HIR_NAV_befriend_KYU_2_desc:0 "Kyushu lacks many raw materials required by its industries. We can negotiate a deal to facilitate their access to our markets - and all resources from our vast colonial empire - in exchange of some of their territory."
  HIR_crisis_self_rule:0 "Increased Colonial Autonomy"

  HIR_trade_with_all_desc:0 "The history of the Netherlands is a history of merchants, who brought wealth and power. We will continue this history, welcoming all trade partners regardless of their ideology or opinions, and our policy shall be that of \"laissez faire, laissez passer\"."
  HIR_reafirm_european_neutrality:0 "Reafirm Neutrality in Europe"
  HIR_reafirm_european_neutrality_desc:0 "The Netherlands did not partake in the madness that was the Great War, with its millions of dead. If Europe descends into that hell again, Amsterdam will do anything to spare its people from destruction - anything short of surrendering to a foreign invasion."
  HIR_create_voc:0 "V.O.C."
  HIR_create_voc_desc:0 "The \"Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie\" was essentially its own soverign State, and the backbone of the Dutch colonial empire since the 17th century, until it went bankrupt in 1799. But the \"regular\" administration did not fair much better, and some officials believe that the creation of a new chartered company to take over much of the colonial affairs could be both efficient and profitable."
  HIR_allow_migration:0 "European Transmigration"
  HIR_allow_migration_desc:0 "\"No man is an island, entire of itself, every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less.\"\n\nEvery time Europe shakes, refugees are washed away to distant lands. And Europe shook a lot lately."

  HIR_employment_focus_desc:0 "Our employment program was a success, putting Hirado on the path of recovery from the state of social malaise. We must expand it and assure that unemployment is kept at a minimum and that every native subject to our rule works towards the benefit of the colony."
  HIR_align_england:0 "Side with the Democracies"
  HIR_align_england_desc:0 "The Great War was terrible for many reasons, one of which is that was seen as a pointless war - there were no clear villans or heros. But the last decade saw the rise of undeniable authoritarianism and tyranny, and it is clear that if free countries do not stand together, they will perish alone, one at a time."
  HIR_join_allies:0 "Joint Defence Plan"
  HIR_join_allies_desc:0 "Courageous speeches and pledges of support are of little use without effective and coordinated action. Officers of the highests ranks from the democratic side of Europe will develop a joint defence plan to ensure that, should war happens, they will act as one."
  HIR_fortress_holland:0 "Vesting Holland"
  HIR_fortress_holland_desc:0 "The area north of the great rivers and west of the IJsselmeer encompasses by far the larger part of our population and industry. Sacrificing the rest of the country might allow us to hold out long enough in our industrialized area for a more powerful ally to come to our aid in time."
  HIR_relocate_capital:0 "Relocate Capital to Batavia"
  HIR_relocate_capital_desc:0 "The Netherlands are not like Russia, that can endlessly retreat into a deep territory. If our lines are broken, the enemy would be at the capital in no time. Unless we take the necessary measures to relocate the government to the colonies, much like Portugal did when Napoleon invaded. The lost of the homeland would be a serious blows, but it would not decapitate us."

  HIR_land_army_effort_desc:0 "The Great War redefined warfare in all its forms, and many nations, ours included, tried to modernize their forces in the years following it. But technological and doctrinal developments in the late 20s and early 30s made obsolet many of these reforms, and another broad modernization program for our Army is already a dire need."

  HIR_focus_tech_artillery:0 "Focus on Artillery"
  HIR_focus_tech_artillery_desc:0 "The French army proved that artillery is the main tool of a modern army. Producing and supplying modern artillery is the essence of industrialized warfare."
  HIR_focus_tech_rifles:0 "Focus on Light Weapons"
  HIR_focus_tech_rifles_desc:0 "Action of the colonies very often happens in difficult terrain with precarious supply lines - our soldiers can rely on little more than the rifle they carry. Therefore, we must sure that they are given the best one possibles."
  HIR_focus_tech_armor:0 "Focus on Armored Vehicles"

  HIR_naval_effort:0 "Reform Naval Forces"
  HIR_naval_effort_desc:0 "Recent years have shown that Army isn't the only branch of the military to undergo a massive strategy change in recent years. New vessels, new tactics, new dangers and new opportunities. In order to adapt to the world of rapidly-changing naval warfare, our naval doctrines and customs will have to undergo a massive revision."
  HIR_naval_tech_submarine:0 "Focus on Submarine Warfare"
  HIR_naval_tech_submarine_desc:0 "The idea of a submarine was theorised quite a long time ago, but only after the Great War it became on of most important tenets on which naval policy of many great powers rely. The Netherlands cannot lay behind behind other nations: we will allocate major government funds to develop new models of submarines to ensure our dominance under water."
  HIR_naval_tech_anti_sub:0 "Focus on Escort Vessels"
  HIR_naval_tech_anti_sub_desc:0 "There are many dangers to martime trade and military transportation, much like there are threats to an infantry battalion moving through an open field.  For that reason, we must have to ensure that our transport vessels are protected by armed ships, capable of deterring any threat. Hostile submarines are going to tremble at sight of our ships, not the other way around! "
  HIR_naval_tech_capital:0 "Focus on Capital Ships"
  HIR_naval_tech_capital_desc:0 "Some in our naval high command might decry our decision as irrational and irresponsible, citing the high costs of developing and building larger and more formidable types of vessels, but battleships and aircraft carriers shall be developed more intensively than ever, lest we let our enemies dominate us in our own waters!"
  HIR_naval_marines:0 "Modernize the Korps Mariniers"

  HIR_amphibious_invasion_effort:0 "Improve Amphibious Operations"
  HIR_amphibious_invasion_effort_desc:0 "As unfortunate as it might be, our climate and geography are wastly different from that of our colonies. Our tactics, both offensive and defensive, cannot be simply utilised oceans away. In order to ensure combat efficiency and tactical coherence of our troops during a naval invasion of any kind, we must develop new strategies and plans, suited for all types of environment."
  HIR_navy_modernized:0 "Naval Forces Modernization"
  HIR_navy_modernized_desc:0 "We have managed to greatly change our understanding of naval warfare, develop new kinds of vessels and create a more organic connection between land and naval forces.

  HIR_air_force_effort:0 "Reform Air Forces"
  HIR_air_force_effort_desc:0 "Applications of military aircraft have changed drastically over the years. New, hitherto unexplored ways of engaging in aerial combat have been theorised all over the world. For too long, we ignored these developements: our air forces will have to undergo a series of reforms and equipment updates to meet the ever-growing standards of aerial combat."
  HIR_air_tech_fighter:0 "Focus on Fighters"
  HIR_air_tech_fighter_desc:0 "In the early 20th century, the dominant type of light aircraft were the biplanes, developed primarily for reconnaissance purposes. By the end of the Great War, the reality of conventional warfare had changed drastically. Now, it is more important than ever to develop proper fighting planes, capable of engaging in head-on battles with enemy aicraft. "
  HIR_air_tech_nav:0 "Focus on Naval Bombers"
  HIR_air_tech_nav_desc:0 "The threat presented by hostile navies to our colonial and mainland possession cannot be underestimated. However, it is unlikely that we'll be able to easily catch up with major powers in terms of raw naval power. For that reason, sevelal high-ranking officers have proposed to fund developement of new kind of bomber aircraft, one designed specifically to assist our navy and destroy the enemy ships."
  HIR_air_tech_cas:0 "Focus on Close Air Support"
  HIR_air_tech_cas_desc:0 "Armored vehicles were decisive in the final stages of the Great War, and many countries tried to develop anti-tank rifles and more expensive artillery pieces. But as aviation technology improved, it became clear that bombers could be effective counters to armored vehicles - and it seems to be the path forward."
  HIR_air_tech_radar:0 "Advanced Electronics Studies"
