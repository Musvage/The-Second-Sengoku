Another Army Group invaded neutral Belgium - again. The Germans expect to use fast-moving, motorized troops to bypass the two largest foci of French forces: the Maginot Line and the Belgium border, a dangerous proposition that will expose the flanks of the German army but, if successful, will deny any possibility for the French to entrench and fight a defensive war on their terms."

But this time the outcome was entirely different.\n\nAfter violent clashes in the beaches and landing zones, the Axis forces established beach heads and, soon, towns and fields were flooding with enemy forces, and the British army was unable to turn that tide.\n\nAfter a few days of siege, the city of London decided to surrender - lest it was scratched off the map - and the whole cabinet resigned, being put under house arrest. After an armistice was signed, Franz von Papen was appointed to oversee the now-occupied British territory and urged the rest of the Empire to follow suit.\n\nA few hours later, General Bernard Montgomery hastely assembled all the members of parliament he could find and fled the island, proclaiming a government in exile. He vows to fight to the bitter end. If necessary, for years. If necessary, alone."
