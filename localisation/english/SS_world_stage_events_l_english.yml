Erich von Manstein devised a plan and capitalize on his highly mobile army and, now, this plan is in motion.\n\nGerd von Rundstedt's Army Group A started an offensive throught the Ardennes with concentrated armor formations. Another Army Group invaded neutral Belgium - again. The Germans expect to use fast-moving, motorized troops to bypass the two largest foci of French forces: the Maginot Line and the Belgium border, a dangerous proposition that will expose the flanks of the German army but, if successful, will deny any possibility for the French to entrench and fight a defensive war on their terms."

The situation only worsened for the Allies, for a series strategic blunders caused the French army to waste every opportunity to stop the German offensive.\n\nThe Battle of France is over."
