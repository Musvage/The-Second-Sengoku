  OSA_nanko_port:0 "Re-structure Nanko"

  OSA_coastal_defense_vessels:0 "Defend Our Coasts"

If an enemy manages to secure a beachhead on the coasts, our entire nation would lay open and vulnerable. Therefore, we must stop the enemy in the water itself, not giving them any time to land on our beaches. We will achieve this building a tonnes of coastal defense vessels and ships to stop an amphibious invasion, right on its tracks."

However, there are people who were born and bought in Japan, familiar with the terrain, and know every nook and crany of the forests of Japan. Hiring these men into our army, would give us a numbers advantage as well as create employment, which would increase the local confidence in our government."
  OSA_defend_our_homeland:0 "Defense of Osaka"
  OSA_defend_our_homeland_desc:0 "Many of our reports have suggested that our neighbours are definitely planning to strike us when we are at the most vulnerable.

Thus, we must begin to construct a huge chain of fortifications along our coasts, and fortify the main city as well to defend our homeland from foreign invaders!"
