 SSnews.1.d:0 "Less than a year after the Sudeten Crisis and the Annexation of Czechoslovakia by the German Reich, Hitler once more tested the resolve of Britain and France by marching his armies into Prague, under the guise of "restablishing order" he has annexed all czech lands and created a collaborationist regime in Slovakia. The Allies have protested, but no military action has been taken so far."
 SSnews.1.a:0 "Another victim of the Fuhrer's ambition."
 SSnews.2.t:0 "The Tripartite Pact"
 SSnews.2.d:0 "With Japan divided and weakened, the Republic of China rose to a major status among world powers, and a major headache to whoever gets in their way. The various colonies in Chinese soil are in constant danger of invasion, and defending them from the nigh endless amounts of Chinese soldiers seems unfeisable; the Chinese army is as strong as their european counterparts, mostly due to the German military mission led by Alexander von Falkenhausen. With both nations having the same enemies and similar goals, Sino-German relations are at an all-time high, and a military alliance has been formally signed between the now three Axis Powers: Italy, Germany and China. The Allied Powers have once again protested but taken no further steps."

Britain and France have both pledged to come to Poland's aid if the Reich decided to take the Polish Corridor by force. Despite the denial, the Reich has invaded Poland nonetheless, bringing France, Britain and their dominions into another war. Though Poland is expected to fall, the large French Army should make great strides into the industrial heartland of Germany, the Ruhr Valley"
 SSnews.3.a:0 "Europe is once again in flames..."
 SSnews.4.t:0 "The Fall of France"
 SSnews.4.d:0 "The expected French attack never came... Overzealous generals refused to march on Germany, prefering to stick to the outdated Great War tactics of static battles and defensive warfare. These generals never stood a chance against the might of the German panzercorps, which smashed through the Netherlands, Belgium and the Ardennes cutting off the British forces and throwing the entire French army into disarray, With the Fall of Paris there is little hope that the French can mount another defense, but the war goes on for the British in their island and the combined Allied army in Africa. Though still largely untouched, the grasp of the Dutch over the East Indies is straining, especially because of the looming threat of the Chinese Army, ready to kick them out of Asia once and for all." 
 SSnews.4.a:0 "This is far from over..."
 SSnews.5.t:0 "The Dutch Surrender"
 SSnews.5.d:0 "Though they managed to remain neutral in the Great War, the Dutch did not have the same luck this time, and the Wehrmacht plowed through the dutch defenses at lightining speed before the British or French could react in any meaningful way. A government-in-exile was formed in London, but the Germans now control all of the continental Dutch states and the Dutch army is all but destroyed."
 SSnews.5.a:0 "Another blow to the Allies."
 SSnews.6.t:0 "The Dutch Resistence"

The little island nation share some of our ideals, and have wisely accepted our righteous cause. They might be a great asset in our plans... However, some officers say that their ethnicity does not quite match the one needed to be our ally. On the other hand, giving them status of "honorary aryans" and accepting their demands might give us a well needed upper hand over the allied threat."
