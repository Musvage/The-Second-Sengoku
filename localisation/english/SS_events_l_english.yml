However, our society, on this matter is heavily polarized.  A slight majority argues that giving a member of the royalty, complete control of the government would lead to unrest and the provisional government forgetting its main aim, to bring about democracy in Japan. They propose that the King be only given ceremonial work as a unifying factor for the Japanese. This is a narrow path, and one mistake can lead to our government falling to its doom. We must put a lot of thought and consideration into this decision, as it may change our fate forever."

Whatever the case may be, we have acquired a copy of the book, now what should we do with it?"

 SSnews.30.t:0 "The Collapse of the League of Nations"
 SSnews.30.desc:0 "As German Panzer divisions smashed through the hastily built fortifications of Poland, the League of Nations once more stood by, helpless to stop the very thing they were created to prevent.\nThe Palace of Nations, the League's Headquarters, was evacuated, and the Assembly passed most of its power to the Secretary-General, in a symbolic attempt to allow the League to continue its existance.\nExperts believe that this was the final blow to the League of Nations, and any decisions they might take from now on are essentially null and void, given that they no longer have what little power they had to enforce them."

Still, unconfirmed reports claim that [OSA.GetAdjective] troops have acted quickly to secure the port of Amagasaki, to link up the now unified holdings. [OSA.GetName]"
