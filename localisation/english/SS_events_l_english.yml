Regardless of formalities, the reality is that the world took a dangerous step forward."

 SSnews.30.t:0 "The Collapse of the League of Nations"
 SSnews.30.desc:0 "As German Panzer divisions smashed through the hastily built fortifications of Poland, the League of Nations once more stood by, helpless to stop the very thing they were created to prevent.\nThe Palace of Nations, the League's Headquarters, were evacuated, and the Assembly has passed most of its power to the Secretary General, in a symbolic attempt to allow the League to continue its existance.\nExperts believe that this was the final blow to the League of Nations, and any decisions they might take from now on are essentially null and void, given that they no longer have what little power they had to enforce them."
