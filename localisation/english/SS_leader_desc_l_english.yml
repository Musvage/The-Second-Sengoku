 # American Chiba
  POLITICS_GREW_DESC:0 "An experienced diplomat, having served as ambassador for America in a variety of countries, Grew effectively acts as governor to America’s Naval Base and territory at Chiba. Acting as the voice of the United States advising and pressuring policy changes within the Japanese Republic, whom the Americans have historically propped up, Joseph Grew is both loyal to his country and concerned with Japan’s current path. Worried that current American meddling over Japanese democracy is strengthening the cause of those who seek to destroy America’s creation outright, Joseph is more open than most other Western governors in Japan to the prospect of weakening their clutch over Japan."
  POLITICS_SORIANO_DESC:0 "Successful industrialist, especially in the alcohol market, Andrés Soriano is the Philanthropist of the Pacific. Ever caring for the wellbeing of his employees, Soriano takes the same care into account when charged with the protection of both the commercial and civil interests of American influences in Japan."

  POLITICS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "Born in 1880, Douglas MacArthur is the son of Arthur MacArthur and a distant relative to Matthew Perry, The man who ended Japan’s era of total isolation. MacArthur’s history had a history with Japan prior to his current posting in Chiba. Particularly inspecting the status of American naval stations across Shogunate Japan prior to the First World War. With additional experience in operations across the Pacific area and in the political field, while simultaneously not being a high-standing commissioned officer, MacArthur has been an easy choice for military guidance over America’s peripheral operations in Japan."
  POLITICS_FUJIMOTO_DESC:0 "The ringleader of the Communist movement in Hawaii, Charles Fujimoto has struck a deal for American Chiba to continue as an autonomous authority over the region while maintaining ideological cohesion with Leftist Japan.

 # Chugoku Military Junta
  POLITICS_HATA_DESC:0 "The successor to Kazushige Ugaki, Hata now commands as a warlord of warlords. The very existence of his state is borne out of the armies confidence in their right to govern Japan as a principled and uncorrupted force. Yet the years of stagnation by the military machine in the South has rapidly degraded the internal strength of the Republic’s old army. Hata is a warlord trying to bring order to a government of other warlords An impossible task. Whether Hata’s conviction will see him through or his leadership shall fall to the ambitions of those he commands remains to be seen."
  POLITICS_MUTO_DESC:0 "A native of Kyushu, Akira Mutō became infamous among the military ranks of Chugoku for his increasingly hardline views on dealing with the opposition to the Military Junta’s efforts to restore order and clarity to Japanese governance. It was this trait as a stickler for order than made him an ideal candidate for the fascist, ultranationalist government that has settled itself within the military government."
  baronmuto:0 "Born to an ex-samurai family within the Saga Domain, Mutō’s family lost its place following the Shogunate victory during the Boshin war. His lineage has since never buried the hatchet it festered for their poor choice of allegiance during the war. Despite being a staunch military man, Nobuyoshi Mutō has consequently made an ideal candidate to form a Pro-Royalist authority within the original military staff of Japan."
  POLITICS_HAMAI_DESC:0 "A relatively low-level civil servant within the civil administration for Hiroshima city under its military authority. Hamai become popular for his peripheral role in Pro-Democracy circles within Chugoku while it was under martial rule. With Chugoku now under its new democratic authority, Shinzo has been placed in charge of the local autonomous government to represent the interests of his people."
  POLITICS_YAMAKAWA_DESC:0 "A committed socialist, Hitoshi has come to power in his native region due to his past role in organising the Communist uprisings that occurred in Chugoku during the collapse of Japan. Still a popular among the socialists who have silently awaited his return, Hitoshi has now been charged with building up Marxist governance within the local communities and handling the reactionary influences embedded within the area."
  POLITICS_FUJITA_DESC:0 "The prominent civil servant for Hiroshima until gaining his present post, Wakami Fujita was notably apolitical during the military governance of Chugoku. Neither protesting their rule nor condoning it. His acceptance to contribute his experiences and abilities towards the Democratic Socialist elements who have taken prominence within Chugoku politics is therefore of little surprise."

 # Republic of Ezo
  POLITICS_KATAYAMA_DESC:0 "The Social-Democratic Leader of the Ezo Republic, Tetsu has come to rule Ezo as a comfortable bridge between the winds of socialist change that swept through the Japanese Republic in 1930 and continued respect for the old democratic system prior to the July Crisis. While not at regular odds with the politics of the Tokyo government, President Katayama has continued to serve as one of the few regime leaders in Japan prepared to reconcile and cooperate with the Republic."
  POLITICS_ARAKI_DESC:0 "A descendant of the Samurai and born in Tokyo, Araki has become one of the many ethnic Japanese occupants of Ezo. Having traveled there as part of an arrangement for him to take the reins of protecting the nation under the Provisional Government’s reunification, Araki has taken full control as a result of the loose coalition of Rightist and the Ainu tribe-folk taking power."
  POLITICS_KIDO_DESC:0 "Born in Tokyo, one might be surprised to see Koichi in power within Hokkaido. But the Ezo Republic’s predominant electorate are the ethnic Japanese of the island; who do not particularly care if their representative is a local. Having previously worked in the civil service for agriculture, Kido is extremely familiar with the agricultural aspects of Hokkaido and as such has been placed in charge to protect the island’s economy."
  POLITICS_KITOKURO_DESC:0 "A native to modern day Kakegawa, Baron Kitokuro was neither born during the days before the Emperor’s exile nor held any particular fanatical monarchist values during the days of the Shogun running solo. However, his recent defection from the civil service to the political opportunities in the Kyoto government has seen him reach a position of interim governor for Ezo until it can be restored to the fold of the Empire of the Rising Sun."
  POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "A fervent anti-communist within the Siberian White Russians armies, Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov became the ringleader for the organisation of the exiled white russian troops and officers that fled to the safety of Northern Japan following their defeats in the Russian Far East. His militarist determination has since seen him rise to power; committed to rallying the Russian Right for one last majorly organised effort to contest Soviet power in Mother Russia."
  POLITICS_ISOO_DESC:0 "The renowned Christian Leftist, Abe Isoo, has been placed upon the gubernatorial chair of the Republic of Ezo. Known for his staunch commitment to peaceful change. Abe is determined to reach out to reactionaries and liberals with an olive branch and to teach that Socialist belief through dialogue and peaceful debate to win over the hearts and minds of the people."

Now assigned to the management of the Dutch governorate in Hirado, which the Netherlands seized less than five years before the total collapse of the Republic. A staunch supporter of benevolent colonialism, De Graeff’s main priorities are to win the hearts and minds of Dutch Hirado and to promote a mediated reunification of Japan."

 # Imperial State of Kansai
  POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "Emperor Showa has returned to the home of his ancient family. Decades of exile in the United Kingdom since the end of the Boshin War have come to an end. Since being smuggled back into the country with British backing via Osaka during the crisis in 1930, Emperor Showa has been growing ever more successful in his path to restoration. Once limited to little more than Kyoto, Hirohito’s cause has led to expansion through conquest and municipal defections alike. The history, promises and cause of the Monarchy have left few across the islands to outright despise the Young Emperor. But decades of Republican and Shogunate rule, combined with the reactionary cause that the imperial family backed during the Boshin War, has left Japan disillusioned with the perfection of monarchy. To many Hirohito is just another, albeit honourable, tyrant in this age of division."
  POLITICS_KOTOHITO_DESC:0 "Born during the Boshin War, Kan'in Kotohito, alongside the imperial family, had to be evacuated. In his exile, he developed a strong distaste of the Shogun and of the Republic alike. Now as the leader of hte country, let's see if he follows that up."

 # French Kobe
  POLITICS_CATROUX_DESC:0 "Unlike the other European territory leaders, Georges Catroux is not primarily a diplomat. Instead, Catroux is first and foremost a general. Assigned to the effectively French-controlled sphere over Kobe, General Catroux’s main task and responsibility has firstly been to cement French military control over the city following the breakdown of Japan; secondly to actually govern it. Catroux would sooner die than relinquish Kobe to an invader without direct orders from his government. But with war looming on the home continent, is there any Catroux can do to stop such an event with a skeleton garrison to man the city?"
  POLITICS_MOUTET_DESC:0 "It seems unlikely that a socialist would involve himself in colonization, but here Marius Moutet is. Supportive of communist movements worldwide, it seems like this is a quite unusual way of spreading his ideals."

Born to a wealthy merchant family, Sanzo’s entry into Marxist circles has brought about respect from many avenues of Communist thought. Committed to the standing policy of cooperation between the countless interpretations and agencies of the Japanese Communist movement, Sanzo has thus far prevented internal collapse and disunity but at the price of a clear direction. His more modest, reformist ideals have also left many to hold him responsible for the Communist uprising’s inability to take control over the entire country early into the Liberal Republic’s collapse. While relatively respected by those outside the movement, this growing popular dissatisfaction internally may stop even Nosaka from holding the communist groups together."
