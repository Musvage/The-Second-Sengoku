 ostasien.1.d:0 "Today, a giant joins the heavens. Erich von Ludendorff died of an untreatable cancer, after a lifetime of unwavering dedication to Germany.\n\nIf his presence made the country greater, and we cannot allow his absence to make it lesser. While Werner von Bloomberg takes the office of Chancellor, every citizen of Germany must carry on the task of making it ever greater."

 ostasien.5.d:0 "The Germans based on [REI.Capital.GetName] decided to place their bets on the Seto Islands controversy, and they think [IMS.GetLeader] is the winning horse.

While the idea of a union of both nations dates back to the 19th century, the Great War appeared to have ended the dream of a Greater Germany once and for all. However, the leading Western powers lack the will to enforce the peace that they imposed on their former enemies."

 ostasien.12.d:0 "Before the nation can recover from the recent news, another disaster was heralded: the temperature in the Reichstag rises as the leaderless politicians waste no time in arguing about the succession of the executive authority. While there is a legal procedure to be followed, everyone knows that boldness of action and support from the people and the army counts more than ink on paper. Who will lead Germany now?"

 ostasiencthulhu.1.t:0 "An Interesting Discovery"
 ostasiencthulhu.1.d:0 "Our leading archaeologist, René Belloq, announced the most unexpected discovery: beneath an abandoned Shinto temple, there was an entrance to a very old crypt. It seems to predate any known human activity in Japan - and its very cyclopean architecture poses the question if it was even built by humans. But the real prize was found inside a fish-shaped sarcophagus, a tome written in a forgotten language.\n\n"The Necronomicon\", Belloq said, his gaze drawn to its cover, which resembles a screaming face.\"It must be... comprehended.\"
 ostasiencthulhu.1.a:0 "Study this... Necronomicon."

 ostasiencthulhu.2.d:0 "Torches blazed and secret chants were phrased. As they started to cry, hands held to the sky, René Belloq walked forward reading the Necronomicon in a language that he only partially understood.\n\n\"There is no turning back now\", said Belloq, \"the ritual has begun, Cthulhu's work will soon be done\".\n\nAs the night was shattered by dawn, all witnesses to the ritual were transformed - not physically, for their shapes were still human, but the void that lies outside the galaxy flooded their souls."

 ostasiencthulhu.4.t:0 "Otherworldly Strength"
 ostasiencthulhu.4.d:0 "Numbed by the knowledge that conscience is but an illusion, many of our people are willing to withstand any danger while what is still left of them can be used to further the power of the Old Ones."
