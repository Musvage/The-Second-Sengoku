 ostasiencthulhu.2.t:0 "An Eldritch Ritual"
 ostasiencthulhu.2.d:0 "Torches blazed and secret chants were phrased. As they started to cry, hands held to the skyes, René Belloq walked forward reading the Necronomicon in a language that he only partially understood.\n\n\"There is no turning back now\", said Belloq, \"the ritual has begun, Cthulhu's work will soon be done\".\n\nAs the nigth was scattered by dawn, all witnesses to the ritual were transformed - not phisically, for their shapes were still human, but the void that lies outside the galaxy flooded their souls."
 ostasiencthulhu.2.a:0 "We shall free ourselves from the shackles of reason."
 ostasiencthulhu.2.b:0 "And I thought those Germans couldn't get any crazier."
 ostasiencthulhu.3.t:0 "Unknowable Knowledge"
 ostasiencthulhu.3.d:0 "Contact with the Old Ones yields unusual boons: our once-sharp minds now remember things that are yet to be learnt, but are already long forgotten. As the universe unfolds itself inside our brains, reason becomes an ever cheaper currency in dealings with the Old Ones."
 ostasiencthulhu.3.a:0 "I am one with nothingness."
 ostasiencthulhu.4.t:0 "Otherworldly Strength"
 ostasiencthulhu.4.d:0 "Numbed by the knowledge that conscience is but an illusion, many of our people are willing to withstand any danger while what is still left of them can be used to further the power of the Old Ones."
 ostasiencthulhu.4.a:0 "We are like time: unstoppable."
 ostasiencthulhu.5.t:0 "Crippling Madness"
 ostasiencthulhu.5.d:0 "Nighmares spread among the population like a drop of poison on a goblet. Screams crack the silence like lighnings in the night. Prayers turn into gibberish, clocks turn into kaleidoscopes and madmen turn into light houses."
 ostasiencthulhu.5.a:0 "They begin to uncomprehend the lie that is reason."
 ostasiencthulhu.5.b:0 "We dream of the Abyss, the Abyss dreams of us."
 ostasiencthulhu.6.t:0 "Acolytes of Dagon"
 ostasiencthulhu.6.d:0 "After a ritual for which we lack words to describe, and mental faculties capable of remembering, a group of our most devoted men drawned themselves and came back with their strength doubled."
 ostasiencthulhu.6.a:0 "What is dead may never die."
