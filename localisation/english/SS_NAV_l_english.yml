 navigator.1.d:0 "We have been approached by representatives of [FROM.GetNameDef], who sought to improve the relations between our countries.\n\nBesides the usual and protocolar exchange of pleasantries and stating of good intentions, they made a genuine effort to convey their message: that friendly relations between us is paramount for the peace and stability in the region. They asked if we would be interested in further talks for cooperation and defence."
 navigator.1.a:0 "Their initiative is welcome."
 navigator.1.b:0 "We politely decline."

 navigator.4.d1:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap], as a member of the League of Nations, denounced the [ROOT.GetAdjective] administration in [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. According to a statement written personally by [FROM.GetFirstTitle] [FROM.GetLeader], the [ROOT.GetAdjective] routinely violate their subjects' rights, imposing a de facto two-tier system of citizenship. \"This discrimination cannot go unresponded by the international community.\".\n\n[ROOT.GetSecondTitle] [ROOT.GetDualLeaderName] defended the conduct of his nation, stating that the accusations were \"uninformed at best\" and \"most likely a fabrication\". The accusation, however, was more convincing, and the League decided to dispatch a group of observers to study the situation."

 navigator.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] Turns Blind Eye to Pirates!"
 navigator.5.d:0 "Pirates seem to roam free in the waters near [FROM.Capital.GetName], praying on [ROOT.GetAdjective] civilian ships. The government in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] accused [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] of deliberately turning a blind eye to the criminals.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader], [FROM.GetAdjective] [FROM.GetFirstTitle], denied the accusations, putting the blame on [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName]'s ineffective administration instead. It is clear that the [FROM.GetAdjective] will not change their policy - or lack of - regarding the freebooters.\n\nWhile the two governments trade insults, actual [ROOT.GetAdjective] trade will continue to suffer."
 navigator.5.a:0 "This is sabotage!"
 navigator.5.b:0 "It's not our problem!"
 navigator.6.t:0 "Trade & Territorial Negotiations"
 navigator.6.d:0 "Envoys from [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] returned, with a message signed by [FROM.GetLeader]. They propose a treaty that would involve the ceding of territores in exchange for significant trade concessions.\n\nOur advisers have reviewed the proposal and the terms are acceptable, but such an important decision requires careful political consideration."
 navigator.6.a:0 "These are fair terms."
 navigator.6.b:0 "These terms are not acceptable."

 navigator.7.d:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] accepted our proposal for trade and territorial concessions.\n\nRepresentatives from [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] and [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] signed the comprehensive treaty in a cheerful cerimony. The treaty includes the exchange of territories, and soon after administrators of the ceded towns and villages pledged to uphold the treaty, as agreeded, being peacefully incorporated into their new nation."
 navigator.7.a:0 "Our position is strengthened."
 navigator.7.b:0 "A civilized exchange."
 navigator.7.c:0 "We now have to repaint some of our maps."

 navigator.8.a:0 "Not what we expected..."
 navigator.9.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Foments Dissent in [ROOT.GetName]"
 navigator.9.d:0 "Agents from [FROM.GetNameDef] are helping our opposition. They contacted local leaders in [ROOT.GetName] and the surrounding areas, providing money and other forms of help, like printing gear and broadcast equipment.\n\nWhile this aid is purely \"civilian\", fomenting dissent will eventually lead to a military problem."
