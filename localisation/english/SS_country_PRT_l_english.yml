 ### EVENTS
  portuguese.1.t:0 "Restoration of the House of Bragança"
  portuguese.1.d:0 "The enlightened promises made before every republican coup seldom are fulfilled, and it was not different with Portugal's. After the overthrow of the King Manuel II in 1910, Portugal only saw more authoritarianism, and without the freedoms and guarantees of proper democracies, the new regime was indistinct from the old.\n\nAfter Portugal was dragged into the Spanish conflict, in which the word \"república\" was synonymous with \"enemy\", the monarchist cause only grew stronger. Prime-Minister Salazar, understanding the contradiction of his own government, avoided the issue by sponsoring the Bragança loyalists. It culminated with a plebiscite that returned of the crown to Manuel's son, now King, Duarte Nuno."
  portuguese.1.a:0 "A capable hand will guide Portugal."

Their participation in the bloody conflict in Spain only fueled their ambition, accusing Salazar of being \"soft\" on the opposition and the \"inneficiency\" of sharing power with President Carmona.\n\nAfter careful maneuvers and the right amount of threats, Francisco de Barcelos Rolão Preto, leader of the National Syndicalist movement, convinced the Parliament to pass a vote of no confidence, removing Salazar from office and appointing himself as Chief of State. He proposed an amendment to the 1933 Constitution abolishing the office of President, and became the sole ruler of Portugal."
  portuguese.2.a:0 "A strong hand will guide Portugal."
