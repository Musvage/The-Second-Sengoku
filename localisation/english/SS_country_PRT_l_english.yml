 ### EVENTS
  portuguese.1.t:0 "Restoration of the House of Bragança"
  portuguese.1.d:0 "The enlightened promises made before every republican coup seldom are fulfilled, and it was not different with Portugal's. After the overthrow of King Manuel II in 1910, Portugal only saw more authoritarianism, and without the freedoms and guarantees of proper democracies, the new regime was indistinct from the old.\n\nAfter Portugal was dragged into the Spanish conflict, in which the word \"república\" was synonymous with \"enemy\", the monarchist cause only grew stronger. Prime Minister Salazar, understanding the contradiction of his government, avoided the issue by sponsoring the Bragança loyalists. It culminated with a plebiscite that returned the crown to Manuel's son, now King, Duarte Nuno."
  portuguese.1.a:0 "A capable hand will guide Portugal."
  portuguese.1.b:0 "Interesting."
  portuguese.1.c:0 "Portugal takes another step backwards."
  portuguese.2.t:0 "National Syndicalists Take Over Portugal"
  portuguese.2.d:0 "Despite Prime Minister Salazar's skilled conduction of political affairs, he failed to appease the more reactionary officers and politicians. Their participation in the bloody conflict in Spain only fueled their ambition, accusing Salazar of being \"soft\" on the opposition and the \"inneficiency\" of sharing power with President Carmona.\n\nAfter careful manoeuvres and the right amount of threats, Francisco de Barcelos Rolão Preto, leader of the National Syndicalist movement, convinced the Parliament to pass a vote of no confidence, removing Salazar from office and appointing himself as Chief of State. He proposed an amendment to the 1933 Constitution abolishing the office of President, and became the sole ruler of Portugal."
  portuguese.2.a:0 "A strong hand will guide Portugal."
  portuguese.2.b:0 "Interesting."
  portuguese.2.c:0 "Portugal becomes even more reactionary."
  portuguese.3.t:0 "Elections Scheduled in Portugal"
  portuguese.3.d:0 "Cracks begin to show in Salazar's regime: despite his successful economic policies and stable conduction of State affairs, the opposition simply refuses to vanish into irrelevance.\n\nQuite the opposite: adversaries of the regime, both moderate reformists and those more enthusiastic about social changes, are closing ranks and demanding a general election, a final appeal to the Portuguese people itself to arbitrate the rightfulness of $PRT_neutrality_party_long$'s government from themselves."
  portuguese.3.a:0 "The people will surely endorse Salazar."
  portuguese.3.b:0 "The people want democratic reforms."
  portuguese.3.c:0 "The people want deeper reforms."
  portuguese.3.e:0 "Portugal is on the right path."
  portuguese.3.f:0 "Will Portugal be ruled by mobs?"
  portuguese.3.tt1:0 "Elections will happen in six months."
  portuguese.3.tt2:0 "\nIf §H$PRT_neutrality_party_long$§! wins:"
  portuguese.3.tt3:0 "\nIf §H$PRT_democratic_party_long$§! wins:"
  portuguese.3.tt4:0 "\nIf §H$PRT_democratic_socialism_party_long$§! wins:"
  portuguese.300.t:0 "Electoral Campaign Begins!"
  portuguese.300.d:0 "After much pressure and negotiation with the opposition, the first free general election in Portugal is finally on the horizon. The electoral campaign begins today, and Salazar's authority will be tested, as candidates of every party - or every allowed party, at least - wave their flags and deliver their speeches.\n\nThe elections are due to happen in thirty days when Portugal's fate will be decided."
  portuguese.300.a:0 "Alea iacta est!"
  portuguese.300.b:0 "The colonies will back Salazar."
  portuguese.300.c:0 "The colonies will back the opposition."
  portuguese.301.t:0 "Intolerant Rhetoric Backfires"
  portuguese.301.d:0 "If the difference between remedy and poison is the dose, then right-wingers must be trying to kill themselves: their intransigent proposals have utterly rejected this election."
  portuguese.301.a:0 "Things look bad to the right."
  portuguese.302.t:0 "Public Opinion Against Salazar"
  portuguese.302.d:0 "The Salazar and his claque are having trouble adapting to these new times, and many voters are tired of their antiquated proposals."
  portuguese.302.a:0 "Are Salazar's days over?"
  portuguese.303.t:0 "Trouble with Reformist Candidates"
  portuguese.303.d:0 "It seems that the reformist candidates are having trouble getting their message across, and many voters are turning their attention to other parties."
  portuguese.303.a:0 "Salazar's days are not over yet."
  portuguese.304.t:0 "Patriotic Sentiment Spreads"
  portuguese.304.d:0 "There seems to be a wave of nationalistic sentiments during this election, and the word \"fatherland\" can be heard from the mouths of ordinary people."
  portuguese.304.a:0 "Is Salazar a softer leader than we thought?"
  portuguese.305.t:0 "Salazar Maintains His Popularity"
  portuguese.305.d:0 "\"When you don't know what to do, don't do anything\" is what King Dom João VI used to say, but today's people live by it, unwilling to bet on new political proposals."
  portuguese.305.a:0 "The people don't want to rock the boat."
  portuguese.306.t:0 "Opposition Campaign Gains Traction"
  portuguese.306.d:0 "Union leaders and intellectuals - some of them, rather radical characters - are holding large rallies, where fiery speeches are heard."
  portuguese.306.a:0 "Are Salazar's days over?"
  portuguese.311.t:0 "Democratic Coalition Wins Portuguese General Election"
  portuguese.311.d:0 "After a difficult campaign, especially given how much of the State apparatus Salazar mobilized for his side, the democratic opposition emerged victorious from the ballot boxes.\n\nThe $PRT_democratic_party_long$, with support from colleagues of the $PRT_democratic_socialism_party_long$, managed to secure the majority of seats in Parliament, and wasted no time in dismantling Salazar's regime."
  portuguese.311.a:0 "The dictatorship is over!"
  portuguese.311.b:0 "The Portuguese are a free people now!"
  portuguese.311.c:0 "The outcome was expected."
  portuguese.312.t:0 "Democratic Coalition Wins Portuguese General Election"
  portuguese.312.d:0 "After a difficult campaign, especially given how much of the State apparatus Salazar mobilized for his side, the democratic opposition emerged victorious from the ballot boxes.\n\nThe $PRT_democratic_socialism_party_long$, with support from colleagues of the $PRT_democratic_party_long$, managed to secure the majority of seats in Parliament, and wasted no time in dismantling Salazar's regime."
  portuguese.312.a:0 "The dictatorship is over!"
  portuguese.312.b:0 "The Portuguese are a free people now!"
  portuguese.312.c:0 "The outcome was expected."
  portuguese.313.t:0 "Monarchists Win Portuguese General Election"
  portuguese.313.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the Portuguese population not only rejected Salazar's regime but the republic itself.\n\nA ragtag group of Bragança loyalists managed to steer the course of the election and secured a majority of monarchist representatives in Parliament, and, as their first act, denounced the republic and invited Dom Duarte Nuno to accept the crown of the - now styled - Kingdom of Portugal."
  portuguese.313.a:0 "The republic brought nothing but trouble!"
  portuguese.313.b:0 "Real reason prevailed, in the end."
  portuguese.313.c:0 "That was unexpected."
  portuguese.314.t:0 "National Syndicalists Win Portuguese General Election"
  portuguese.314.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the Portuguese population rejected Salazar, but not in favour of the democratic opposition.\n\nThe National Syndicalists, with their more aggressive rhetoric, swayed the population and managed to secure a majority in Parliament. They removed Salazar from office after a vote of no-confidence, electing their leader, Francisco de Barcelos Rolão Preto, as Prime Minister right after."
  portuguese.314.a:0 "Our future is glorious."
  portuguese.314.b:0 "Portugal chose to be strong."
  portuguese.314.c:0 "That was unexpected."
  portuguese.315.t:0 "Salazar Wins Portuguese General Election"
  portuguese.315.d:0 "As sure as the sun rises on the East and sets on the West, Salazar once again proved to be the superior politician and managed to maintain his support in the Parliament.\n\nHaving won against the democratic opposition on their terms, there is little doubt left that Salazar will rule Portugal for the foreseeable future undisturbed by any serious challengers."
  portuguese.315.a:0 "All as it should be!"
  portuguese.315.b:0 "Salazar is indeed a capable leader."
  portuguese.315.c:0 "No news here, then."
  portuguese.2222.t:0 "The Devolution of Macau"
  portuguese.2222.d:0 "desc "
  portuguese.2222.a:0 "accept"
  portuguese.2222.b:0 "refuse"
  portuguese.2222.tt:0 "[ROC.GetName] peacefully assumes the administration of Macau.\n\nIt will diminish the possibility of war with Portugal if we complete the national focus §H$ROC_denounce_treaties$§!."
  portuguese.101.t:0 "The Sunrise Crusade"
  portuguese.101.d:0 "By the grace of God, it is our sacred duty to purge these lands of the heathens. Centuries ago, when the words of the Lord were first spread in the Land of the Sun, our compatriots were persecuted by the Shogunate. While the rest of the world continues to move towards sin, we will make our stand here and avenge the martyrs of the east.\n\nLet no family claim ignorance in the crusade to come, for we shall fight for God, homeland and family until all of Japan bathes under his true light."
  portuguese.101.a:0 "Deus Vult."
