 seto_islands.0.t:0 "A Brewing Crisis"
 seto_islands.0.d:0 "After warlords and radicals torn the country apart, none cared to occupy the islands of the Seto Sea. But no vacuum of power lasts, and we made those islands our own.\n\nBut we are few, and our resources are fewer, and our position is strategic for the conflict that brews between the rump states. Our independence will be contested, sooner or later, and we may be forced to choose to join one of our neighbours: the army in Chugoku and the radicals in Shikoku. Or stand fast and face whichever fate awaits us."
 seto_islands.0.a:0 "We must thread carefully."
 seto_islands.1.t:0 "Time to Choose a Path"
 seto_islands.1.d:0 "There is dissent among our ranks: the rulling clique of the Seto Islands is split between those who are still pro-independence and supporters of [CHU.GetName] or [SHI.GetName]. There is a lingering threat that those who favor a \"peaceful unification\" with any of our neighbours will seize an empity rock in the middle of the sea, proclaim an independent government and formally invite an intervetion. There is also the possibility of, even if we do pick a side, the other party will refuse to accept and escalate tensions further.\n\nTherefore, we cannot postpone the decision: will we pick a side, or will we fight to maintain our independence?"
 seto_islands.1.a:0 "The Seto Islands will rule themselves!"
 seto_islands.1.b:0 "The Seto Islands belong to Chugoku"
 seto_islands.1.c:0 "The Seto Islands belong to Shikoku"
 seto_islands.2.t:0 "Seto Islands Ask to Join Chugoku"
 seto_islands.2.d:0 "The crisis in the Seto Sea may be heading to a conclusion, as [IMS.GetLeader] officially announced its decision to merge with [CHU.GetNameDef]. The pro-Chugoku party prevailed over both the Shikoku supporters and the pro-independence faction. However, this may not be the end of the trouble: the independence faction managed to stall the process, while the pro-Shikoku scrambled to respond and asked [SHI.GetLeader] to intervene in their favor.\n\nIf Shikoku acquiesces to [IMS.GetLeader]'s decision, the annexation will happen and the crisis will be, hopefully, over. But if it does not, it will take one more step towards an open conflict."
 seto_islands.2.ims:0 "May our history end not in bloodshed."
 seto_islands.2.chu:0 "A suitable end of this crisis."
 seto_islands.2.accept:0 "We respect their decision."
 seto_islands.2.challange:0 "We do not relinquish our claims!"
 seto_islands.2.other:0 "Is the crisis over?"
 seto_islands.3.t:0 "Seto Islands Reafirm Their Independence"
 seto_islands.3.d:0 "The crisis in the Seto Sea took an unexpected turn, as [IMS.GetLeader], [IMS.GetFirstTitle] of [IMS.GetNameDef], declared to his government and a few invited journalists that \"the Seto Islands will rule themselves\", and refused the possibility of peacefully joining any of its stronger neighbours. However, this may not be the end of it: partisans of both Chugoku and Shikoku wasted no time in denouncing [IMS.GetLeader] and asked their allies to intervene.\n\nThe next chapter of this crisis will depend on [CHU.GetLeader]'s and [SHI.GetLeader]'s willingness to accept an independent Seto Sea government or to seize it by force."
 seto_islands.3.ims:0 "Our history does not end here."
 seto_islands.3.accept:0 "We respect their decision."
 seto_islands.3.challange:0 "We do not relinquish our claims!"
 seto_islands.3.other:0 "Is the crisis over?"
 seto_islands.4.t:0 "Seto Islands Ask to Join Shikoku"
 seto_islands.4.d:0 "The crisis in the Seto Sea may be heading to a conclusion, as [IMS.GetLeader] officially announced its decision to merge with [SHI.GetNameDef]. The pro-Shikoku party prevailed over both the Chugoku supporters and the pro-independence faction. However, this may not be the end of the trouble: the independence faction managed to stall the process, while the pro-Chogoku scrambled to respond and asked [CHU.GetLeader] to intervene in their favor.\n\nIf Chugoku acquiesces to [IMS.GetLeader]'s decision, the annexation will happen and the crisis will be, hopefully, over. But if it does not, it will take one more step towards an open conflict."
 seto_islands.4.ims:0 "May our history end not in bloodshed."
 seto_islands.4.shi:0 "A suitable end of this crisis."
 seto_islands.4.accept:0 "We respect their decision."

 seto_islands.5.t:0 "[ROOT.GetSetoCrisisWinner] Annexes Seto Sea Islands"
 seto_islands.5.d:0 "The dispute over the control of the Seto Sea ended with [ROOT.GetSetoCrisisWinner] prevailing over both [ROOT.GetSetoCrisisLooser] and the pro-independence voices in the Seto Islands government.\n\nAfter an internal power struggle, [IMS.GetLeader] decided to accept [ROOT.GetSetoCrisisWinner]'s terms for a peaceful annexation and [ROOT.GetSetoCrisisLooserLeader], surprisingly, decided to accept that decision, ending the conlfict without bloodshed."
 seto_islands.5.winner:0 "A suitable end to this crisis."
 seto_islands.5.looser:0 "It was not worth a war."
 seto_islands.5.other:0 "Peace prevailed."
 seto_islands.6.t:0 "Peaceful Resolution to the Seto Sea Crisis"
 seto_islands.6.d:0 "The threat of a war over the islands in the Seto Sea faded after both [CHU.GetLeader] and [SHI.GetLeader] decided to accept the decision by the Seto Islands government to remain independent.\n\nDespite its barren resources, the Set Sea islands are important due to their strategic location, and that alone lead to a battle of nerves between the local government and those in Chugoku and Shikoku. [IMS.GetLeader] did not blink, and manege to conduct his country through the crisis and emerge victorious."
 seto_islands.6.ims:0 "A suitable end to this crisis."
 seto_islands.6.shichu:0 "It was not worth a war."
 seto_islands.6.other:0 "Peace prevailed."
 seto_islands.61.t:0 "Escalation in the Seto Sea Crisis"
 seto_islands.61.d:0 "[IMS.GetLeader]'s decision that the Seto Islands would remain independent did not go unchallenged: [ROOT.GetLeader] announced that it would not relinquish [ROOT.GetName]'s claims over the territory and that he was in talks with dissenters within the Seto Islands government that prefered unification with his country.\n\nBoth sides sharp their knifes, but few doubt that, if a war break out, [IMS.GetLeader] would prevail without some substantial external support. Internal unity and careful diplomacy are paramount to maintain their independence."
 seto_islands.61.ims:0 "We will not yield!"
 seto_islands.61.accepted:0 "Do they really want a war?"
 seto_islands.61.challanger:0 "This is not over yet!"
 seto_islands.61.other:0 "Can war be avoided?"
 seto_islands.7.t:0 "Pressure on the Seto Islands Government"
 seto_islands.7.d:0 "After the back-and-forth of envoys and representatives, pressure over local officials and calls for international aid, the reality is that a sizeable faction within [IMS.GetLeader]'s own government favors unification with us, and their top brass made a formal declaration in that direction and invited us to intervene in their favour.\n\nWe could issue an ultimatum to that stubborn government, demanding their surrender and annexation within 24 hours. Should [IMS.GetLeader] refuse, it would mean war. Are we prepared for it?"
 seto_islands.7.a:0 "Issue an ultimatum!"
 seto_islands.7.b:0 "We will recognize their independence."
 seto_islands.71.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Gives Up on the Seto Islands"
 seto_islands.71.d:0 "[FROM.GetLeader], [FROM.GetFirstTitle] of [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName], issued an brief comuniqué to foreign representatives announcing that he would not interfere with [IMS.GetLeader]'s decision to remain independent from his larger neighbours. This is in sharp contrast to the saber-rattling coming from [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName], which led many to believe that war was imminent. Many are left scratching their heads, trying to understand this sudden change of position, and some even begun questioning [FROM.GetLeader]'s leadership over the whole controversy.\n\nRegardless of what caused their larger neighbour to finally accept their decision, the fact is that [IMS.GetNameDef] will continue as an independent State, at least in the near future."
 seto_islands.71.ims:0 "Free at last?"
 seto_islands.71.from:0 "The islands were not worth a war."
 seto_islands.71.other:0 "In the end, reason prevailed."
 seto_islands.8.t:0 "A Diplomatic Victory"
 seto_islands.8.d:0 "After the back-and-forth of envoys and representatives, pressure over local officials and calls for international aid, the reality is that there is no sizeable faction within [IMS.GetLeader]'s government willing to collude with either Chugoku or Shikoku in order to force an unification or provoke an invasion. The [IMS.GetFirstTitle] emerged victorious from the crisis, without shedding a single drop of blood.\n\nRegardless of what caused their larger neighbour to finally accept their decision, the fact is that [IMS.GetNameDef] will continue as an independent State, at least in the near future."
 seto_islands.8.ims:0 "Free at last?"
 seto_islands.8.shichu:0 "The [IMS.GetFirstTitle] outplayed us."
 seto_islands.8.other:0 "In the end, reason prevailed."
 seto_islands.9.t:0 "Ultimatum from [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]"
 seto_islands.9.d:0 "Some pro-[FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] elements within our government colluded with [FROM.GetLeader] and his clique and managed to \"formally\" invite their intervention. Their document apparently has some semblance of legitimacy, at least enough to convince the international community to look the other way.\n\nJust now, our representative in [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] was handed an ultimatum, demanding that we surrender the control of our defense force to their officials and accept the uncondicional annexation of our territory. How should we reply?"
 seto_islands.9.refuse:0 "Come and take it."
 seto_islands.9.accept:0 "No blood will be shed today."
 seto_islands.10.t:0 "Seto Islands Defy [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]"
 seto_islands.10.d:0 "Despite the disparity of forces, the autonomous government of the Seto Islands decided to stand its ground and refused to accept annexation by [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]. [FROM.FROM.GetLeader] followed through on his promise and declared war on the Confederation.\n\nThe issue is now out of the hands of politicians: it will be settled by generals."
 seto_islands.10.enemy:0 "We were left with no other option."
 seto_islands.10.other:0 "Is [IMS.GetLeader] mad?"
 seto_islands.11.t:0 "Seto Islands Accept Ultimatum"
 seto_islands.11.d:0 "After intense pressure from [FROM.FROM.GetNonIdeologyName], [IMS.GetLeader] realized that further resistence was futile and announced that his government would comply with the demands from its larger neighbours. While no one doubted the Seto [IMS.GetFirstTitle]'s conviction is his own cause, the harsh reality is that refusal to comply would mean an invasion against which he could not resist."

 seto_islands.13.d:0 "After [IMS.GetLeader]'s announcement that the Seto Sea islands would join [GetSetoCrisisWinner], [ROOT.GetFirstTitle] [ROOT.GetLeader] from [GetSetoCrisisLooser] announced that his country would not accept such annexation and any moves in that direction by [GetSetoCrisisWinner] would be considered a declaration of war.\n\nThe [GetSetoCrisisLooser] foreign office issued a comuniqué accepting the possibility of an independent Seto Islands government as a buffer State between them and [GetSetoCrisisWinner], and set it as the one and only condition to maintain peace."
 seto_islands.13.war:0 "War it is."
 seto_islands.13.peace:0 "It's not worth a war."
 seto_islands.14.t:0 "[GetSetoCrisisWinner] Gives Up on Seto Sea"
 seto_islands.14.d:0 "The final chapter of the crisis of the Seto Sea ended without bloodshed, althought the participants came dangerously close to an open war. After [IMS.GetLeader] and [GetSetoCrisisWinnerLeader] negotiated the annexation of the islands by [GetSetoCrisisWinner], [GetSetoCrisisLooserLeader] threatened a war if the plan moved forward. In the battle of nerves, [GetSetoCrisisWinnerLeader] blinked first and backed down.\n\nWhether or not [GetSetoCrisisLooser] was actually prepared for a war, it managed to stop the annexation and the strategicly important islands will remain neutral, and [GetSetoCrisisWinner]'s position in the region not only did not improve, but they must now deal with a serious blow to their reputation."
 seto_islands.14.ims:0 "We are on our own again..."

 seto_islands.15.t:0 "War in the Seto Sea!"
 seto_islands.15.d:0 "The crisis over the Seto Sea islands culminated in an all-out war between Shikoku and Chugoku. After [IMS.GetLeader] and [GetSetoCrisisWinnerLeader] negotiated the annexation of the islands by [GetSetoCrisisWinner], [GetSetoCrisisLooserLeader] threatened a war if the plan moved forward. But the leaders in [GetSetoCrisisWinner] did not blink, and formally annexed the islands, incorporating its (small) defenses forces into their own.\n\n[GetSetoCrisisLooserLeader] was left with no option other than to follow through with his threats and declared war on [GetSetoCrisisWinner]. If the control of the islands hang in the balance before, now their whole countries are at stake."
 seto_islands.15.favored:0 "We'll fight for what is ours."
 seto_islands.15.challanger:0 "They left us with no alternative."
