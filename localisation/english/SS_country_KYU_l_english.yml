 # FOCUS
  KYU_back_yamamoto_1:0 "The First Among Equals"
  KYU_back_yamamoto_1_desc:0 "The traditional noble families of Kyushu resent the breakdown of the Shogunate's order and distrust the \"republican\" Assembly in Fukuoka. To maintain unity, they must be reminded that Isoroku Yamamoto is himself a member of a steemed noble family which entitles him to be viewed as an equal by the many daimyo of Kyushu."
  KYU_ally_clans:0 "Peerage Reform"
  KYU_ally_clans_desc:0 "The old feudal structures of our nation hold us back from modernization. Yamamoto proposes a reform of our nobility, merging the \"daimyo\" (feudal nobles) and the \"kuge\" (court nobles) into a single class, the \"kazoku\", meaning \"exalted lineage\". This new class will be represented by a legislative body based on the British Model, a chamber of lords in addition to the existing assembly."
  KYU_clan_generals:0 "Yield Control of the Army"
  KYU_clan_generals_desc:0 "After the Navy and the Army split and established competing administration, Kyushu was left with very few army officers, most of them inexperienced and unqualified. Many of the nobles, however, had careers in the army and could be an useful addition to our ranks: we could fire the least qualified officers and call the nobles to command our forces."
  KYU_cult_of_personality:0 "Cult of Personality" 
  KYU_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Yamamoto was already one of our most respected military leaders, but sadly there is not such unanimity when it comes to our civilian leadership. By uniting around the figure of Yamamoto, and entrusting him with the corresponding responsabilities, we could overcome this political divide."
  KYU_find_pretenders:0 "Pretenders to the Chrysanthemum Throne"
  KYU_find_pretenders_desc:0 "While Hiroito rules from Kyoto, there are plenty of close relatives who are equally suitable for the job. The legitimacy of our cause would be greatly enhanced by the presence of a rightful claimant to the throne."
  KYU_cross_rubicon:0 "Cross the Rubicon"
  KYU_cross_rubicon_desc:0 "History remembers the great men, those who rise to meet the challanges of their time. Yamamoto, like Caesar, is the one who can end the factional struggle and unite Kyushu towards a new destiny. It is time to cross the Rubicon."
  KYU_kyushu_shogunate:0 "To Caesar What is Caesar's"
  KYU_kyushu_shogunate_desc:0 "While traditionally the Shogun was a head of government, the Emperor was head of State, with important cerimonial functions. We should restore the old order and install our claimant in the throne, investing him with his rightful prerogatives. Of course, Yamamoto will be the Emperor's Shogun, entrusted with the conduction of government."
  KYU_satsuma_academies:0 "Satsuma Academies"
  KYU_satsuma_academies_desc:0 "Many members of the low nobility, specially former military, did not adjust well to the social and economic revolutions of the last decades. Seeking to preserve the old ways, many of them settled in the South of Kyushu and set up martial arts schools. But now that the very existance of Japan is at risk, they will not hesitate to don their uniforms and sally forth to fight."
  KYU_satsuma_academies_tt:0 "Gains two units with §H4 teppo samurai§! and one §!recon§! support company"
  KYU_order_66:0 "Abolish the Assembly"
  KYU_order_66_desc:0 "With the Chamber of Peers firmly established and the authority over practical matters held exclusively by Isoroku Yamamoto, the Kyushu Gikai became all but a nuisance: it is time it is abolished and to complete the consolidation of power."
  KYU_back_koga_1:0 "Rally the Disgruntled Officers"
  KYU_back_koga_1_desc:0 "Yamamoto styles himself as the one leader capable of holding Kyushu - and Japan - together, but this opinion is not an unanimity outside his inner circle. Many officers, unhappy with his leadership, seek another man to take charge, and they believe that Mineichi Koga is that man."
  KYU_back_koga_2:0 "Appointees in the General Staff"
  KYU_back_koga_2_desc:0 "Through careful maneuver, Mineichi Koga can gain support within the higher echelons of the armed forces. While strategic and political decisions made at the High Command are not \"democratic\", a majority of officers sympathetic to his cause can sway the internal balance of power towards him."
  KYU_back_koga_3:0 "Challange Yamamoto"
  KYU_back_koga_3_desc:0 "It is time to remove Isoroku Yamamoto from the position of ultimate authority, and appoint Mineichi Koga as head of the civilian executive branch and commander-in-chief of all armed forces in Kyushu. Under his firm leadership, the political chaos in Kyushu will be brought to an end, the first step towards greater ambitions."
  KYU_disarm_clans:0 "Confiscate Weapons"
  KYU_disarm_clans_desc:0 "The decentralized nature of Kyushu's administration means that the nobility owns their own caches of weapons. If we want to neutralize their threat to the Fukuoka government, we must seize these weapons at once and end further opposition."
  KYU_invite_nagano_1:0 "The Double Leaf Society"
  KYU_invite_nagano_1_desc:0 "The Futabakai - \"Double Leaf Society\" - is an ultra-nationalist organization whose members are, above all, committed to mend the schism that afflicts Japan and are ready and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that goal. They are dissatisfied with the current leadership in Kyushu and are in talks with officers outside the island - Osami Nagano, they believe, is the man of the hour."
  KYU_invite_nagano_2:0 "Invite Osami Nagano"
  KYU_invite_nagano_2_desc:0 "So far, the Futabaki has operated within Kyushu. But now it has enough internal support to move into the main stage, the broader politics of Japan. It is time to call on our supporters outisde Kyushu to join us, Osami Nagano the most important of them all!"
  KYU_press_propaganda:0 "Propaganda Campaign"
  KYU_press_propaganda_desc:0 "The first battle of any campaign is fought at home, gathering enough support for greater endeavours. We should start a propaganda offensive to build consensus around our project and diminish any support for our opponents."
  KYU_pan_asianism:0 "Yūzonsha"
  KYU_pan_asianism_desc:0 "The Yūzonsha - \"Society of Those Who Yet Remain\" - is a radical nationalist and pan-Asianist organization, founded in 1919. Its rather unorthodox political views set it appart from other nationalists groups, but they find cause with them in their opposition to the Western influence in Japan."
  KYU_depose_junta:0 "All Power to the Kyushu Gikai!"
  KYU_depose_junta_desc:0 "The voice of the people is the voice of God, they say. If that's the case, the Kyushu Gikai should have the final word on every matter, for it is the embodyment of the will of Kyushu's people - at least, as long as the Futabakai commands a majority."
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_shi:0 "Back Shikoku's Claim"
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_shi_desc:0 "The government in Shikoku, while a competing force in the struggle for Japan, is not completely strange to our ideals. Therefore, we should lend our support for the most like-minded side in the confliect over the isles of the Seto Sea."
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_ims:0 "The Cotton Between Crystals"
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_ims_desc:0 "If we plan to unify Japan, we must make sure no one regional government is too strong before it is we who have the strength to lead unification. It is, then, our strategic interest to support an independent government in the Seto Sea and to avoid that any of our larger neighbours gain control of these important straits."
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_chu:0 "Back Chugoku's Claim"
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_chu_desc:0 "Some argue that if it wasn't for the split between Army and Navy, an united military could have prevented the dismemberment of Japan. As show of goodwill towards our brothers in arms, we should openly back their claims to the islands of the Seto Sea against the ideological extremists of Shikoku."
  KYU_arrest_opposition:0 "Arrest Yamamoto's Partisans"
  KYU_arrest_opposition_desc:0 "Yamamoto's influence goes deeper into the admnistration than anyone could have guessed. We must thoroughly scrutinize the personel in every level of government and get rid of those whose loyalty is in doubt."
  KYU_dangerous_coalition:0 "A Dangerous Coalition"
  KYU_dangerous_coalition_desc:0 "The Double Leaf Society calls for a final unification of Japan and actively undermine any faction that do not act with sufficient haste toward that goal. Maybe inviting their leaders to formally join the government will persuade them of our commitiment, strengthening our position instead."
  KYU_industrial_effort_1:0 "Economic Commission"
  KYU_industrial_effort_1_desc:0 "The current crisis that split Japan can be ended only by the faction that can maintain the tripod of internal legitimacy, military strength economic stability. To solve the later, the Kyushu Gikai approved the creation of an Economic Commission, which shall advise the executive branch and propose plans to develop our industrial sector."
  KYU_civilian_industry_effort_1:0 "The Kodama Plan"
  KYU_civilian_industry_effort_1_desc:0 "Kodama Kyūichi is one of the counsellors in the Economic Commission. He presented a plan to expand our production of consumer goods, laying the ground work for future liberalisation efforts."
  KYU_civilian_industry_effort_2:0 "Subsidize Yawata Steelworks" #Focus on Heavy Industries
  KYU_civilian_industry_effort_2_desc:0 "Heavy industries, like steel and other construction materials, are essential to long term economic growth, however, they require substantial investments. The business class of Kyushu lacks the means to fund such enterprises, thus the Economic Commission proposes an investment plan by the government, freeing private capital for other viable endeavours."
  KYU_civilian_industry_effort_3:0 "Economic Liberalisation"
  KYU_civilian_industry_effort_3_desc:0 "A step towards laissez-faire economics will make our economic more dynamic. THe Economic Commission believes it is time to pass on the recently-built heavy industry to the private sector and focus its focus its attention in othe areas."
  KYU_military_industry_effort_1:0 "The Takuo Plan"
  KYU_military_industry_effort_1_desc:0 "Takuo Godo is an industrialist with a seat in the Economic Commission. He proposed a plan to boost our production of military equipment, a first step in a plan of economic mobilisation to prepare Kyushu for a future - but inevitable - conflict."
  KYU_military_industry_effort_2:0 "Subsidize Idemitsu Shokai" #Focus on Fuel & Supplies
  KYU_military_industry_effort_2_desc:0 "With a steady production of equipment, the Economic Commission identified the production of fuel and supplies as the most severe bottleneck currently hampering our military industry. The Commission, then, proposes to increase our investments in those two sectors."
  KYU_military_industry_effort_3:0 "Economic Mobilization"
  KYU_military_industry_effort_3_desc:0 "The current state of Japan leaves no room for half measures. The Economic Commission prepared a mobilization plan consisting of a complete survey of our industrial capacity, allocation of work force and retooling of existing production lines. Once enacted, the government will be able to quickly and effectively steer our production to meet the needs of our armed forces."
  KYU_technology_industry_effort:0 "Fukuoka Technical School"
  KYU_technology_industry_effort_desc:0 "The recent increase of industrial production caused a scarcity of skilled labourers. There is no way of solving this issue other than expanding our existing trade schools to prepare more workers to join the industrial sector."
  KYU_technology_industry_effort_2:0 "Fukuoka University"   # better name?
  KYU_technology_industry_effort_2_desc:0 "No country can be an industrial powerhouse without a steady supply of highly-qualified engineers and chemists. Those professions required a more sophisticated education system, and we must increase funding to our universities towards that end."
  KYU_solomonic_solution:0 "Solomonic Solution"
  KYU_solomonic_solution_desc:0 "After the Great War, the smaller islands south of Kyushu became a point of conflict between Japan and the United States. The Americans refused to give up the territory when their government and Japan's disagreed over the interpretation of the peace treaty. Perhaps we should soften our stance on the issue to find a agreeable middle term."
  KYU_demand_okinawa:0 "Demand Okinawa"
  KYU_demand_okinawa_desc:0 "The insolent Americans used a reasonable diplomatic protest by the Japanese as an excuse to occupy - illegally! - the islands East of Okinawa. If politeness and adherence to international law did not brought an end to this transgession, we must change our approach: we will demand them to leave our territories, or else."

Despite its many flaws, the League is still our best hope for solving controversies without violance - and we have many ongoing controversies in Japan, to say the least."
  KYU_western_advisers:0 "Western Military Mission"
  KYU_western_advisers_desc:0 "The military hegemony of the West is undeniable. Luckly, our good relations with some of the most important Western nations allow us to negotiate treaties of military cooperation that include exchange programs of foreign officers to help modernize our forces, which can remedy our lack of experienced army officers."
  KYU_western_advisers2:0 "Technological Cooperation"
  KYU_western_advisers2_desc:0 "Foreign officers can only do so much for our armed forces if our industry can not manufacture and repair the equipment they are taught to use. Cooperation with Western powers must inclde training of mechanics and engineers."
  KYU_war_council:0 "War Council"
  KYU_war_council_desc:0 "The makeshift nature of our civilian administration means that the Kyushu Gikai and the executive branch lacked a proper ministry or secretariat for strictly military matters, relying so far on the bureaucracy from the police and the remaining chain of command of the armed forces. A new War Council will bridge the gap between the civilians and the military."

  KYU_reformed_military_academy:0 "Fukuoka Army Academy"
  KYU_reformed_military_academy_desc:0 "We still lack in army officers, and the only long-term solution is to open a new military academy.

  KYU_nav_av_effort_desc:0 "The Japanese were to first to successful launch an air attack from a carrier: in 1914, seaplanes carried by the Wakamiya took off to help the Germans besieged in Tsingtao.
