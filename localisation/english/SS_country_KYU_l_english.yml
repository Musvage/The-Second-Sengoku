 # FOCUS
  KYU_back_yamamoto_1:0 "The First Among Equals"
  KYU_back_yamamoto_1_desc:0 "The traditional noble families of Kyushu resent the breakdown of the Shogunate's order and distrust the \"republican\" Assembly in Fukuoka. To maintain unity, they must be reminded that Isoroku Yamamoto is himself a member of a steemed noble family which entitles him to be viewed as an equal by the many daimyo of Kyushu."
  KYU_ally_clans:0 "Peerage Reform"
  KYU_ally_clans_desc:0 "The old feudal structures of our nation hold us back from modernization. Yamamoto proposes a reform of our nobility, merging the \"daimyo\" (feudal nobles) and the \"kuge\" (court nobles) into a single class, the \"kazoku\", meaning \"exalted lineage\". This new class will be represented by a legislative body based on the British Model, a chamber of lords in addition to the existing assembly."
  KYU_clan_generals:0 "Yield Control of the Army"
  KYU_clan_generals_desc:0 "After the Navy and the Army split and established competing administration, Kyushu was left with very few army officers, most of them inexperienced and unqualified. Many of the nobles, however, had careers in the army and could be an useful addition to our ranks: we could fire the least qualified officers and call the nobles to command our forces."
  KYU_cult_of_personality:0 "Cult of Personality" 
  KYU_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Yamamoto was already one of our most respected military leaders, but sadly there is not such unanimity when it comes to our civilian leadership. By uniting around the figure of Yamamoto, and entrusting him with the corresponding responsabilities, we could overcome this political divide."
  KYU_find_pretenders:0 "Pretenders to the Chrysanthemum Throne"
  KYU_find_pretenders_desc:0 "While Hiroito rules from Kyoto, there are plenty of close relatives who are equally suitable for the job. The legitimacy of our cause would be greatly enhanced by the presence of a rightful claimant to the throne."
  KYU_cross_rubicon:0 "Cross the Rubicon"
  KYU_cross_rubicon_desc:0 "History remembers the great men, those who rise to meet the challanges of their time. Yamamoto, like Caesar, is the one who can end the factional struggle and unite Kyushu towards a new destiny. It is time to cross the Rubicon."
  KYU_kyushu_shogunate:0 "To Caesar What is Caesar's"
  KYU_kyushu_shogunate_desc:0 "While traditionally the Shogun was a head of government, the Emperor was head of State, with important cerimonial functions. We should restore the old order and install our claimant in the throne, investing him with his rightful prerogatives. Of course, Yamamoto will be the Emperor's Shogun, entrusted with the conduction of government."
  KYU_satsuma_academies:0 "Satsuma Academies"
  KYU_satsuma_academies_desc:0 "Many members of the low nobility, specially former military, did not adjust well to the social and economic revolutions of the last decades. Seeking to preserve the old ways, many of them settled in the South of Kyushu and set up martial arts schools. But now that the very existance of Japan is at risk, they will not hesitate to don their uniforms and sally forth to fight."
  KYU_satsuma_academies_tt:0 "Gains two units with §H4 teppo samurai§! and one §!recon§! support company"
  KYU_order_66:0 "Abolish the Assembly"
  KYU_order_66_desc:0 "With the Chamber of Peers firmly established and the authority over practical matters held exclusively by Isoroku Yamamoto, the Kyushu Gikai became all but a nuisance: it is time it is abolished and to complete the consolidation of power."

  KYU_disarm_clans:0 "Confiscate Weapons"
  KYU_disarm_clans_desc:0 "The decentralized nature of Kyushu's administration means that the nobility owns their own caches of weapons. If we want to neutralize their threat to the Fukuoka government, we must seize these weapons at once and end further opposition."

  KYU_press_propaganda_desc:0 "The first battle of any campaign is fought at home, gathering enough support for greater endeavours. We should start a propaganda offensive to build consensus around our project and diminish any support for our opponents."

  KYU_depose_junta:0 "All Power to the Kyushu Gikai!"
  KYU_depose_junta_desc:0 "The voice of the people is the voice of God, they say. If that's the case, the Kyushu Gikai should have the final word on every matter, for it is the embodyment of the will of Kyushu's people - at least, as long as the Futabakai commands a majority."
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_shi:0 "Back Shikoku's Claim"
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_shi_desc:0 "The government in Shikoku, while a competing force in the struggle for Japan, is not completely strange to our ideals. Therefore, we should lend our support for the most like-minded side in the confliect over the isles of the Seto Sea."
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_ims:0 "The Cotton Between Crystals"
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_ims_desc:0 "If we plan to unify Japan, we must make sure no one regional government is too strong before it is we who have the strength to lead unification. It is, then, our strategic interest to support an independent government in the Seto Sea and to avoid that any of our larger neighbours gain control of the straits."
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_chu:0 "Back Chugoku's Claim"
  KYU_seto_crisis_back_chu_desc:0 "Some argue that if it wasn't for the split between Army and Navy, an united military could have prevented the split of Japan. As show of goodwill towards our brothers arms, we should openly back their claims to the islands of the Seto Sea against the ideological extremists of Shikoku."
  KYU_dangerous_coalition:0 "A Dangerous Coalition"
  KYU_dangerous_coalition_desc:0 "The Double Leaf Society calls for a final unification of Japan and actively undermine any faction that do not act with sufficient haste toward that goal. Maybe inviting their leaders to formally join the government will persuade them of our commitiment, strengthening our position instead."
