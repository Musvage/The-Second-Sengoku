    startup_flavour.1.t:0 "Rise of the Black Dragon"
    startup_flavour.1.desc:0 "More than a bunch of fugitives, the fascists have managed to carve their state. Their position is still weak though. All sorts of partisans are raging along the countryside, and even worse - fascist parties are anything but united. Right on Shikoku borders, a bunch of bigger threats grows. We should keep an eye on these Isles up north, who knows whom will they sell themselves to?"
    startup_flavour.1.a:0 "The Black Dragon shall prevail!"
    
    startup_flavour.2.t:0 "Uncertain Allegiances"
    startup_flavour.2.desc:0 "The southernmost of the Home Islands, Kyushu, was seized by the Navy when Japan fell apart. Isoroku Yamamoto, the most prominant member of the admiralty, set up a whole new political apparatus and appointed himself its executive authority. The \"Kyushu Gikai\", a Parliament based in Fukuoka, turned the island into a functional State.\n\nDespite these efforts, the island is far from stable and there is already a growing opposition to Yamamoto's rule. A clique of officers led by Mineichi Koga seeks to replace Yamamoto and right-wing radicals of the \"Futabakai\" - the \"Double Leaf Society\" - plot to take the reins and lead an effort to unity Japan. The plot thickens with the rebellious clans across Kyushu. However, despite their dissatisfaction with the "republican" Parliament, Yamamoto still has their admiration and holds undisputed prestige among the nobility. Perhaps... no!, don't even think of it...\n\nWhile the political future of Kyushu is uncertain, whoever prevails will have to rebuild its land forces, choose a economic plan and resume the navy's construction program. On top of the internal struggle in the island and Japan as a whole, whoever rules the island will have to deal with the contested territories of Hirado, Nagasaki and all the islands from Tanegashima to Okinawa. The Europeans are more likely to accept mutually beneficial deals, but there is not much that could be offered to the Americans."
    startup_flavour.2.a:0 "Kyushu will endure the storm."
    
    startup_flavour.3.t:0 "The Far Eastern Republic"
    startup_flavour.3.desc:0 "After the break up of Japan, the Soviets took the advantage. The surrounding Kuril Islands were occupied, and now they want more. The Ezo Republic is housing the old white Russian enemies of the revolution, something that deeply worries the Soviets. After the defeat of Mao Zedong, the Tohoku Peasant Republic must be protected. Communism will prevail in Asia!"
    startup_flavour.3.a:0 "For the Motherland!"
