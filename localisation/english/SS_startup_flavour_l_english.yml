 #Flavour startup events
    startup_flavour.1.t:0 "Rise of the Black Dragon"
    startup_flavour.1.desc:0 "More than a bunch of fugitives, the fascists have managed to carve their own state. Their position is still weak though. All sorts of partisans are raging along the countryside, and even worse - fascist parties are anything but united. Right on Shikoku borders, a bunch of bigger threats grows. We should keep an eye on these Isles up north, who knows whom will they sell themselves to?"
    startup_flavour.1.a:0 "The Black Dragon shall prevail!"
    
    startup_flavour.2.t:0 "The ones that rule the Seas"
    startup_flavour.2.desc:0 "After the Naval Junta establishment, the Admiralty quickly realized that running a country is not the same as running a fleet. Our army command is not as bad as it could be, neither it is good. Our civilian structures are being ruined by corruption. As soon as we put an end to the internal problems, we shall take a look on the lands of our formerly united motherland, and do what we obligated to, eviscerate Military Junta traitors."
    startup_flavour.2.a:0 "Holy duty to save the country!"
    
    startup_flavour.3.t:0 "The Far Eastern Republic"
    startup_flavour.3.desc:0 "After the break up of Japan, the Soviets took the advantage. The surrounding Kuril Islands were occupied, and now they want more. The Ezo Republic is housing the old white Russian enemies of the revolution, something that deeply worries the soviets. After the defeat of Mao Zedong, the Tohoku Peasant Republic must be protected. Communism will prevail in Asia!"
    startup_flavour.3.a:0 "For the Motherland!"
