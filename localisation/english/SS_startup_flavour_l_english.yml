    startup_flavour.1.t:0 "Rise of the Black Dragon"
    startup_flavour.1.desc:0 "More than a bunch of fugitives, the fascists have managed to carve their state. Their position is still weak though. All sorts of partisans are raging along the countryside, and even worse - fascist parties are anything but united. Right on Shikoku borders, a bunch of bigger threats grows. We should keep an eye on these Isles up north, who knows whom will they sell themselves to?"
    startup_flavour.1.a:0 "The Black Dragon shall prevail!"
    
    startup_flavour.2.t:0 "Uncertain Allegiances"
    startup_flavour.2.desc:0 "The southernmost of the Home Islands, Kyushu, was seized by the Navy when Japan fell apart. Isoroku Yamamoto, the most prominant member of the admiralty, set up a whole new political apparatus and appointed himself its executive authority. The \"Kyushu Gikai\", a Parliament based in Fukuoka, turned the island into a functional State.\n\nDespite these efforts, the island is far from stable and there is already a growing opposition to Yamamoto's rule. A clique of officers led by Mineichi Koga seeks to replace Yamamoto, and right-wing radicals of the \"Futabakai\" - the \"Double Leaf Society\" - want to take the reins themselves and lead an effort to unity Japan. The plot thickens with the rebellious clans across Kyushu. However, despite their dissatisfaction with the "republican" Parliament, Yamamoto still has their admiration and holds undisputed prestige among the nobility. Perhaps... no, don't even think of it...\n\nWhile the political future of Kyushu is uncertain, whoever prevails will have to rebuild its land forces, choose a economic plan and resume the navy's construction program. On top of the internal struggle in the island and Japan as a whole, whoever rules the island will have to deal with the contested territories of Hirado, Nagasaki and all the islands from Tanegashima to Okinawa. The Europeans are more likely to accept mutually beneficial deals, but there is not much that could be offered to the Americans."
    startup_flavour.2.a:0 "Kyushu will endure the storm."
    
    startup_flavour.3.t:0 "The Far Eastern Republic"
    startup_flavour.3.desc:0 "After the break up of Japan, the Soviets took the advantage. The surrounding Kuril Islands were occupied, and now they want more. The Ezo Republic is housing the old white Russian enemies of the revolution, something that deeply worries the Soviets. After the defeat of Mao Zedong, the Tohoku Peasant Republic must be protected. Communism will prevail in Asia!"
    startup_flavour.3.a:0 "For the Motherland!"
    
    startup_flavour.4.t:0 "The Great Navigators"
    startup_flavour.4.desc:0 "Portugal's days of glory seemed to be a distant memory, but the Iberian nation snatched a piece of Japan after the end of the Great War. Another war looms - a springboard for new conquests, or the final act of one of Europe's greatest epics.\n\nWhatever are its plans for the future, if Portugal wants a more active participation in the world's affairs, it will have to pick a side in the brewing conflict in Spain. But for strictly Japanese affairs, Nagasaki must deal with its two immediate neighbors: the Dutch in Hirado and the disgruntled naval commanders in Kyushu, be it with diplomatic overtures or an aggressive stance.\n\nOn the domestic front, Portugal must develop its home and colonial resources, and decide how to handle its colonial subjects. The choice is between a policy of tolerance or one of assimilation. Respecting its subject's culture and religion will make reduce resistance if - or when - Portugal expand its colonial empire, but fueling its own religious zeal can be a source of strength in the wars to come."
    startup_flavour.4.a:0 "Portugal was the first to reach Japan and - God willing - it will be the last to leave!"
    
    startup_flavour.5.t:0 "The Edge of the Sword"
    startup_flavour.5.desc:0 "The Kingdom of the Netherlands was untouched by war when the Great Powers threw their sons at each other and brought themselves to the brink of destruction. Now, war looms again but neutrality is being openly questioned. Some argue for siding with democracies and a joint defense plan, to thwart German ambitions once and for all. On the other side, pro-German voices call for the withdraw from the League of Nations and to join Germany's ideological crusade. While trying to avoid being dragged into another continental conflict, Prime Minister Hendrikus Colijn dances a very dangerous dance, to the tune of marching boots and heated speaches.\n\nAway from European politics, the East Indies require attention: the attempts of improving living standards for Dutch colonial subjects fell short of expectations, and the situation in Hirado is particularly bad - the island was acquired as a mandate from the League of Nations after the Great War, but conditions only declined since. The Dutch authorities must choose between prioritizing colonial development or keep focusing their homeland."
    startup_flavour.5.a:0 "The Dutch seek no war: let it not be mistaken for fear."
