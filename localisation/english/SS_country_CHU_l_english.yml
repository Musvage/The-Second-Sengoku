 # Focuses
 CHU_assess_our_situation:0 "Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Armed Forces."
 CHU_assess_our_situation_desc:0 "We have fallen on hard times, and recently we have begun looking for ways to stabilize our nation.

Through this new system of 'Fukoku kyohei' we aim to revitalize our nation's armed forces and civilian sector all in one sweeping motion."
 CHU_air_doctrin:0 "Reform the Samurai of the Skies"
 CHU_air_doctrin_desc:0 "It has been found by internal review that our current air warfare doctrines are woefully outdated. From the advent of more reliable radios to the phasing out of dogfighting and aerial chivalry, the nature of war in the sky has changed. We must change with it or be swept aside by more adaptive foes."
 CHU_build_Kugun:0 "Modernize the Airforce Command Structure"
 CHU_build_Kugun_desc:0 "Our aerial warfare doctrines are changing rapdily to meet the demands of the new age of warfare we are now entering. In order to ensure that our developments in theory are not wasted by mismanagement, we shall establish an independent branch of our military to handle the air force with its own officers and academy."
 CHU_build_Kugun2:0 "Modern Kamikaze"
 CHU_build_Kugun2_desc:0 "For now our eyes are turned squarely on the Home Islands, but it will not always be this way. Once we unify Japan the west will surely come for us. When they come, the Samurai of the Skies will be ready. By drilling and training our air force to prioritize sinking enemy transports, we shall sweep the Gaijin away with our new Divine Wind as the Mongols before. They shall not set foot on our holy soil!"
 CHU_build_Kugun3:0 "Cut Their Tendons"
 CHU_build_Kugun3_desc:0 "While no war can be won by the aifroce alone they can play a vital role in defeating the enemy. We can utilize our aircraft as a sort of flying artillery against the enemy on the field. In addition, we can develope new and better bombers to target their supply lines and starve their armies in the field."

 CHU_build_Kugun6_desc:0 "We have started a grand project to construct many new factories with which to produce aircraft for our fearsome Skyward Samurai.

As such, the workers building the new factories have cheekily referred to them as dragon hatcheries."
 CHU_open_political_sphere:0 "One Nation, One Government, One Army."
 CHU_open_political_sphere_desc:0 "We have managed to stabilize our situation enough to unify the various cliques within our civilian and military administration under centralized rule once again. Now, with them no longer at each-other's throats, we can finally begin to look outward and upward."
 CHU_increase_civillian_influence:0 "The Ballot, Not the Sword"
 CHU_increase_civillian_influence_desc:0 "Democracy for the common man of Chugoku has long seemed like an illusion, something out of reach. This is no longer the case, we have shown the cliques and generals that the pen is equal to the sword. Just as we need them, they need us. A general cannot run a nation, a politician cannot lead an army. Only together, and witht the support of the common man, can Japan be united."
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_democracy:0 "Democracy is Non-Negotiable!"
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_democracy_desc:0 "Now that our sons and brothers have taken up arms to liberate themselves from the oppressive tyranny of the cliques and tyrants they will never consent to being ruled by them again.

 CHU_ally_PRO:0 "Coalition for Freedom"
 CHU_ally_PRO_desc:0 "We are not the only ones who wish to see a free Japan. There are others who share this dream. While we may not agree on every issue what we can agree on is that we must unite against the oppressors. The minutiae can wait until after we have won our freedom."
 CHU_make_a_new_front:0 "A Shared Dream"
 CHU_make_a_new_front_desc:0 "After long talks it has been agreed upon by our senate that we should extend our hands in alliance to the other democratic forces of Japan.

However, this is a kinder fate than collapsing from a bullet to the back of the head."
 CHU_take_seto_island:0 "Secure the Inland Islands"
 CHU_take_seto_island_desc:0 "Seto's many islands are vital to the continued safety of Chugoku. They are a dagger pointed at our heart whilst we do not control them. We must establish dominion over them to ensure our future safety."
 CHU_destroy_fleet:0 "The End of Yamamoto"
 CHU_destroy_fleet_desc:0 "When Yamamoto's betrayal still shines brightly in our minds, a blazing torch illuminating how weak we once were. To ensure another Yamamoto never rises to endanger our new republic he must be made an example of."
 CHU_destroy_SHI:0 "Crusade Against the Fascists"
 CHU_destroy_SHI_desc:0 "Shikoku has been taken over by lunatics and fanatics loyal to an alien ideology. We must cleanse the Japanese Islands of Fascism, and there is no better place to start than Shikoku."

 CHU_spread_democracy_for_kyu:0 "Operation Sun-Nashi"
 CHU_spread_democracy_for_kyu_desc:0 "We’re ready, as ready as we’ll ever be at least. Every day that passes the Naval Junta increases the size of its fleets.

It will be a long and bloody march, but it is a march we have no choice but to embark on."
 CHU_invite_new_democrat_states:0 "The Hiroshima Convention"
 CHU_invite_new_democrat_states_desc:0 "It’s time to speak with the other democratic governments of Japan. We shall send out delegates and officials to the other republics. In Hiroshima we shall toast to the liberation and discuss the future of our nation under democratic principles and what it will look like."
 CHU_annex_denmocratic_states_kyu:0 "Unification with Kyuushu"
 CHU_annex_denmocratic_states_kyu_desc:0 "The time has come to welcome Kyuushu into the New Japanese Republic. Kyuushu shall have the same representation in the senate and the house as any other prefecture.

We welcome Kyushu as a new and equal prefecture in our new republic."
 CHU_annex_denmocratic_states_shi:0 "Unification with Shikoku"
 CHU_annex_denmocratic_states_shi_desc:0 "With the denazification of Shikoku complete, we can now begin organizing regional elections to see what the internal political makeup of the newest prefecture of the Japanese Republic will look like.

 CHU_we_are_enough_for_monarchy:0 "A Popular Bakufu"
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_monarchy_desc:0 "The Tokugawa have had a long and troubled history. However they still serve a purpose. Their role in uniting Japan cannot be forgotten, and many of our people still hold fond feelings for the Tokugawa family. As such, we shall call back to the stability of the Edo period by inviting a Tokugawa family member to rule as a figurehead Shogun. This will send a clear message that we seek to bring the good old days back."
 CHU_ally_SHO:0 "Contact Bakufu Realists"
 CHU_ally_SHO_desc:0 "The Bakufu is not without influential ministers who share our goals of a constitutionally bound Shogun. Regardless of their reasons, our aims are still aligned. We shall reach out to these men to establish a warm report with sympathetic Tokugawa princes."
 CHU_Create_New_Empire:0 "Our Japan, the Only Japan."
 CHU_Create_New_Empire_desc:0 "Japan stands now in a position it has never been in before. We have managed to marry east and west in a fusion that is uniquely Japanese. There are still however those who would stand against the New Japan, and we must show them the error of their ways."
 CHU_recruit_volunteers:0 "The Japanese Youth Corps"
 CHU_recruit_volunteers_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from various western powers, the Shogun has ordered the establishment of the Japanese Youth Corps. This new paramilitary group will be comprised of strapping young Japanese patriots with hearts full of patriotic fervor. The Youth Corps will lead the reservists of our nation proudly, serving as the shining example to follow. "
 CHU_support_shinzo_hamais_policies:0 "The Hamei Reforms"
 CHU_support_shinzo_hamais_policies_desc:0 "Mayor Hamei has been a bastion of just leadership in these dark times. Under his tenure Hiroshima has become a beacon of stability in a sea of chaos. Some are suggesting that we take some of his policies and apply them on a national scale. Once Japan is united once more, textbooks will celebrate the Hamei reforms."
 CHU_sanchi_iron_sand1:0 "Steel for the Forges"
 CHU_sanchi_iron_sand1_desc:0 "Our nation is in drastic need of iron and steel to supply our armed forces.

 CHU_hiroshima_university2:0 "Spare the Nail that Sticks Out"
 CHU_hiroshima_university2_desc:0 "The nail that sticks out is hammered down is a phrase every Japanese knows well. In many ways, this maxim helps promote a harmonious society. But these are unharmonious times, we must be willing to think outside the box. By funding Hiroshima Univeristy we can encourage new scientific advancements from the finest young minds of our nascent nation."
 CHU_Unite_All_Japan_People:0 "True Unity"
 CHU_Unite_All_Japan_People_desc:0 "Countless times in history leaders have claimed to have united their people. All too often this unity fades the second that leader draws their last breath. Many have been called the unifiers of Japan only for the country to shatter after their passing. We cannot reunify Japan, for it has never truly been united. Never, that is, until now. We shall be Japan's first true unifiers."
 CHU_monarchist_technology_sharing:0 "National Scientific Alliance"
 CHU_monarchist_technology_sharing_desc:0 "The Monarchist forces of Japan have united their brightest minds in a National Scientific Alliance to bring Japan into a new age. Together, we shall drag Japan into true modernity, even if some of Japan must be dragged kicking and screaming."
 CHU_monarchist_industry:0 "Unite Restorationist Industry"
 CHU_monarchist_industry_desc:0 "For the sake of Japan we must put aside our differences with the other restorationists. We are allies, and we must finally act like allies. Sharing our industrial knowledge and contributing to one-another's economic growth will strengthen our cause far more than squabbling amongst ourselves."
 CHU_civilian_universty:0 "Japan's Left Hand"
 CHU_civilian_universty_desc:0 "The body politic of our great nation has two mighty hands; The right hand, the military, wields the sword to protect us from our foes and free our countrymen from oppression. Our left hand, our industrial sector, must now equal its twin. It shall wield a mighty hammer to provide for all Japan industry with which to propel our proud nation to true modernity and prosperity."
 CHU_moderate_voice:0 "A Calm But Firm Voice"
 CHU_moderate_voice_desc:0 "To keep a semblance of stability some ground needs to be ceded on both sides. The Junta will seek to rule with a velvet glove henceforth. The civilian government will learn to look to us as a neutral party they can come to for arbitration. With their trust earned, the army will doubtless secure further funding as well."
 CHU_limited_democracy:0 "Stratocratic Democracy"
 CHU_limited_democracy_desc:0 "The people have clamored for a representative voice, but the army provides stability that cannot be threatened by subversive politicians.

 CHU_conserve_the_status_quo:0 "Japanese Stratocracy"
 CHU_conserve_the_status_quo_desc:0 "Are you doing your part? The new Japan will be ruled not by Emperor or Shogun, nor by Prime Minister or Chairman. Though there will be some form of figurehead in the future, all Japan will know who rules this land. The Army will be the Government, and the Government will be the Army. All Citizens will serve in some capacity, for that is the only way we can ensure the survival of Japan in this chaotic age."
 CHU_decentralize_the_junta:0 "Limited Local Autonomy"
 CHU_decentralize_the_junta_desc:0 "In the initial days of our nation, the Junta held onto the land with an iron grasp. This strangled the people, and has cost us dearly. By delegating responsibility to civilian officials to govern their localities in our name, we can save ourselves many headaches in the future. We shall still control the country, but we will no longer have to play the part of bean counter simultaneously."
 CHU_sanyo_fishing_industry:0 "Proclamation No. 8891"
 CHU_sanyo_fishing_industry_desc:0 "Ever since Yamamoto betrayed us and started his own little rogue state up we have lacked a proper navy to counter the threat posed by other factions. Thankfully the San’yo area is well known for its fishing industry and there are several shipyards we could convert so they could construct new warships. As such the Navy has issued a mass requisition order, transferring ownership of all shipyards to the navy."
 CHU_build_yamato_class:0 "The New Dreadnought"
 CHU_build_yamato_class_desc:0 "Just as Dreadnought changed the nature of naval warfare forever, so too will our newest design. This design, a gargantuan steel leviathan called the 'Yamato' will set the new standard. It will be a ship so vastly superior to all existing battleships that we will be undisputed masters of the seas."
 CHU_trade_deal:0 "Deals With the Devils"
 CHU_trade_deal_desc:0 "Our fuel situation is, to put it bluntly, dire. Though we are loathe to request anything of the colonizing barbarians of the west we are left with little choice. We shall trade what we have for what we need until we no longer need to rely on the foreigners."
 CHU_boost_morale_to_the_army:0 "The Privileges of a Soldier"
 CHU_boost_morale_to_the_army_desc:0 "Every since the coup our common soldiery have been asking themselves again and again why they fight. It is time to remind them! We fight not for the Emperor or the Shogun, but for our families and our homes. We shall look to increase the morale of our men by offering them extensive benefits. Morale will doubtless improve now that our men know they are fighting for a state that values their noble efforst."
 CHU_sanchi_iron_sand:0 "Japanese Iron, Japanese Steel"
 CHU_sanchi_iron_sand_desc:0 "Iron is something every military industry needs an infinite supply of. Though no such fountain of Iron exists, there is always tamahagane. A uniquely Japanese form of steel produced from a uniquely Japanese smelting process using Ironsand. We shall establish large scale smelteries to produce vast quantities of tamahagane, thus expanding our industrial capacity."
 CHU_military_factory3:0 "The Suzuki Strategy"
 CHU_military_factory3_desc:0 "Suzuki has come to us with a series of various proposals to expand our military industry. Our industrial ministers have assured us that some of these ideas are actually quite well researched. We shall implement the good ideas he has brought to us, and award him the honorary position of Minister of Industrial Expansion for his efforts."
 CHU_hiroshima_university:0 "Officers Worthy of Our Army"
 CHU_hiroshima_university_desc:0 "We are attempting to inspire a sense of patriotic fervor in our citizen soldiers. These efforts, however, will mean nothing without proper officers to direct the fearless soldiers now graduating from basic training. A new academy for the training of a superior officer corps has been established in Hiroshima. Our officers will be the best and brightest in all Japan!."
 CHU_invite_new_generals:0 "General Amnesty No. 003a"
 CHU_invite_new_generals_desc:0 "While our current General Staff is respectable, we must acknowledge that more experienced Generals are needed. Our current staff is just not large enough to accomodate our ever expanding military. To that end, we will offer conditional amnesty to the various exiled generals of Japan looking for a home. We will keep an eye on them, but we hope it won't be necessary.
 CHU_Chugoku_Fate:0 "The Fate of Chugoku"
 CHU_Chugoku_Fate_desc:0 "All of Chugoku holds its breath, for the fate of the land is being decided. Yamashita has called for a conference of the highest officials to determine what derection we will take. Whatever is discussed in that room, Chugoku will be forever changed by the outcome of that discussion."
 CHU_Tomoyuki_Yamashita_path:0 "Yamashita Declared Marshall"
 CHU_Tomoyuki_Yamashita_path_desc:0 "Yamashita has done it, seizing the reins of power to direct Chugoku to a path of action. No more will we sit idle, Yamashita is a man of action and as such Chugoku will be a nation of action. Japan will be united under the Marshall!"
 CHU_declare_national_hero_Yamashita:0 "Shake Hands, Give Speeches"
 CHU_declare_national_hero_Yamashita_desc:0 "Yamashita was asked by his closest advisors how he planned to cement his authority. His response was simple, he would shake hands and give speeches. Yamashita has made time in his busy schedule to make public appearances where he will give speeches and mingle with the people. By going to them in plain clothes, speaking as they speak, and hearing their woes he will humanize himself to our populace."
 CHU_aggressive_army_order:0 "There Is Only One Direction. Forwards!"
 CHU_aggressive_army_order_desc:0 "Every second not moving is a second wasted. Every second wasted is a victory for the enemy. Our new doctrine will be a doctrine of movement and aggression, we will wage war at lightning speed!"
 CHU_enpower_junta:0 "Entrench Military Leadership of the Nation"
 CHU_enpower_junta_desc:0 "In the new Chugoku everyone will know that the Military is in charge. By establishing new offices of government to oversee and approve the decisions made by the existing civilian government we have sent that message. Nothing happens without our approval, what is good for the military is good for the nation!"
 CHU_purge_officers:0 "Weeding the Garden"
 CHU_purge_officers_desc:0 "The Marshall's latest public appearance was nearly cancelled thanks to an insidious plot by a disloyal element without our officer corps. Thankfully, the culprit was apprehended before anything could go wrong. The Marshall has quietly ordered a thorough series of inspections and audits to ensure the loyalty of our men. Some call it a purge, but we know better."
 CHU_Convince_people_to_fight:0 "Fight for Japan, Fight for the Marshall!"
 CHU_Convince_people_to_fight_desc:0 "Our beloved Marshall is now well and truly beloved by a large portion of our people. He has shown that he is a compassionate leader and a man worth following. At the latest parade in the capital The Marshall will speak to the entire nation in a radio address. There, he will urge the populace to continue their noble struggle to create a new and better Japan."
 CHU_destroy_KAN:0 "Smother the Gaijin-Lover"
 CHU_destroy_KAN_desc:0 "Hirohito is an Emperor, but he is an Emperor corrupted by the barbarians of the west. Japan can no longer tolerate an Emperor in the pocket of foreign devils. We need to replace the Gaijin-Loving fool with a truly Japanese Emperor. To do that, we must first free Kyoto of his anglophilic ministers and strongly encourage Hirohito to retire."
 CHU_new_emperor:0 "The Soldier-Emperor"
 CHU_new_emperor_desc:0 "Kotohito, the Soldier-Emperor. That is what we will refer to the new figurehead monarch as in press releases. Kan'in Kotohito is a man well versed in military matters and a deeply prideful man who sincerely loves Japan. There can be no greater candidate to represent our new Japan as their Emperor."
 CHU_one_emperor:0 "Fireside Chats with the Emperor"
 CHU_one_emperor_desc:0 "Kotohito is beloved by our soldiery, but our civilian populace remain unconvinced. We shall begin a weekly radio programme where the Soldier-Emperor will address the concerns of the people personally. No longer will the Emperor be some far-away man in a capital they've never seen. The people will hear the Emperor's voice, and know he represents them all."
 CHU_create_imperial_allies:0 "Merge the Positions of Shogun and Emperor"
 CHU_create_imperial_allies_desc:0 "Kotohito, the Soldier-Emperor, has come to us with a novel idea. He proposes we declare him Shogun in addition to being Emperor. While this may seem a strange decision, there is in fact nothing that prevents us from doing this. We have decided to give the go-ahead. Now that we have an Emperor and a Shogun, we can look for allies on both sides."

 CHU_invite_old_shogunate_desc:0 "As tempting as it is to cut down the old Tokugawa family and all their supporters, unfortunately we still have need for more expertise. And so by offering a general amnesty to the Tokugawa Shogunate’s officials and personnel we can gain more men and resources without needing to spill blood. And should Kan'in Kotohito step out of line we would have a suitable replacement on hand."
 CHU_war_goal_KAN:0 "Death To The False-Emperors!"

 CHU_annex_SHO_desc:0 "The time has finally come. We have prepared a letter for the Tokugawa demanding they recognize Kan'in Kotohito as Shogun. They will doubtlessly refuse, at which point our armies shall begin the glorious conquest of this outdated rump state."
 CHU_relations_of_interest:0 "The Enemies Of Our Enemies…"
 CHU_relations_of_interest_desc:0 "While diplomacy is far from our speciality even a fool can recognize the worth in reaching out to the enemies of his enemy. While most are likely to be temporary alliances, it’s better than nothing.

Nothing will stop us! We will take Edo back. And with them gone we can wipe away the shame that we have had to bear since the Patey Expedition.

 CHU_take_over_the_west_korea_desc:0 "For years the Korean Empire has puffed its chest and rattled its saber. They seem to think of themselves as the masters of the Sea of Japan.

 CHU_join_the_axis_desc:0 "Though most of the Generals have a justifiable distaste for the Shikoku regime, their allies are powerful.

 CHU_join_the_comitern_desc:0 "Honestly, at this point we've run out of options. We have no choice other than to extend a hand in friendship to the Communists and hope they believe us. If they buy it, at least it will be easier to defeat them when our mutual enemies are destroyed."
 CHU_join_the_allies:0 "An Even More Unthinkable Option"
 CHU_join_the_allies_desc:0 "Well, we hit rock bottom. We thought we'd done it before, but now we've really found it. The bottom fell out of the barrel and we're digging ourselves even deeper into the hole. If we want any hope of uniting Japan, we have to beg the colonizers for help.

 CHU_build_neutrality:0 "Maintain the Illusion"
 CHU_build_neutrality_desc:0 "For too long the Junta has ruled with an iron fist. Marshall Suzuki believes it is high time for a velvet glove to cover that fist up.

 CHU_recruit_volunteer:0 "Without You, Japan Will Burn!"
 CHU_recruit_volunteer_desc:0 "More and more our propaganda ministry is churning out newspaper articles and printing leaflets. What do they say? Nothing more than the truth!

 CHU_solve_supply_problem_desc:0 "It doesn’t matter how many men are in the army. If they don't get their suppies when they need them, they may as well not be in uniform to begin with. There must be no shortages. A soldier must not have to worry about how much or how little ammo he has or how much food he has.

 CHU_land_doctrin6:0 "Experimental Tactics"
 CHU_land_doctrin6_desc:0 "With the advances in motorization and mechanization several of our top men have suggest we adopt more new age tactics.

 CHU_land_doctrin5:0 "Old Ways, New Times"
 CHU_land_doctrin5_desc:0 "While it’s not as glamorous as the idea of punching through the enemy lines with tanks, the old doctrine of superior firepower is what has worked before. It worked for the Great War, and considering all the mountains and hostile terrain in Japan it is better to stick with what is tried, tested, and proven to work."
 CHU_land_doctrin7:0 "The Primacy of Armor"
 CHU_land_doctrin7_desc:0 "Even the most ardent supporters of infantry warfare must admit to the strategic value of tanks. However, despite this truth being acknowledged, we are still sorely lacking in tank development.

 CHU_work_on_our_economy_desc:0 "A nation's military marches on more than its stomach. It requires food, wood, horses, aluminum, iron, steel, and fuel.

 CHU_to_build_an_industry:0 "Industry Now, Not Later"
 CHU_to_build_an_industry_desc:0 "Japan’s industry was never the shining beacon of modernity. The shogunate having been convinced that true economic success lay with agriculture.

 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_desc:0 "As frustrating as it may be for the army the fact of the matter is that we need to give some leeway to the civilians. Many, if not most, already despise the military for the strain on the economy and the mass-requisitioning of food. So the army has to tighten their belts for a time before we can get more equipment."
 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_2:0 "Throw Them A Bone"
 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_2_desc:0 "A lot of civilians are asking where a lot of their money goes and how it benefits them. While the answer is obvious they still aren’t satisfied. So we’ve come up with a solution. We’ll cut back on the manufacturing of some equipment to help in the procuring of better medical supplies for the civilians. Hopefully with the burden of healthcare lightened considerably the wretches will be grateful for once."

 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_1_desc:0 "Despite our supply shortage there is a fear that the workers may try to go on strike or worse, unionize. To prevent any slowdown in production on that kind of scale, or worse the spread of the ideals of the Tohoku Peasant’s Republic, the junta has approved a new work calender which allows for 8 hour work days and a slight cut to taxes."
 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_3:0 "Strategic Investments"
 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_3_desc:0 "Some of our logisticians have suggested investing in some companies and civilian infrastructure.

 CHU_appease_to_the_military_desc:0 "“As much as the civilians may not like it the fact of the matter is that we are at war. They can complain all they like about how they have no rights.

 CHU_appease_to_the_military_1:0 "Industrial Requisition Order"
 CHU_appease_to_the_military_1_desc:0 "The civilian owned factories aren’t producing enough for our military. At this point drastic action is needed.

 CHU_build_Kugun4_desc:0 "More and more airpower has become more and more important. However our aircraft industry is virtually non-existent. To counteract this weakness we must force an aircraft industry into existence. Whether the companies are owned by the junta or by private citizens doesn’t matter. Japan needs this industry."
 CHU_army_arge_research:0 "Soldiers In Lab Coats"
 CHU_army_arge_research_desc:0 "Just as how our military is in constant need of men and supplies, so too is it in need of more research. Japan paid the price for its backwardness once already and if we are to avoid a second humiliation we must have dedicated R&D units. Whether it be in the field of engineering, chemistry, or construction our scientists must be masters in all such fields and must be aided in any and all forms."
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure:0 "A Japanese Engineer Corps"
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_desc:0 "With the development and improvement of the automobile over the years roads have become more critical. But our roads are currently insufficient to allow for adequate trucking capabilities. To resolve this a new engineering corps, based off the one in the United States, shall begin work on improving and building roads to allow for efficient and rapid supply for the upcoming restoration of order."
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_west:0 "Southern Roads…"
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_west_desc:0 "With the concerns for the security in the south increasing it has become more and more imperative that our roads are able to accommodate the troops in the area, whether that be to get them there or to resupply them. As such several bulldozers and tractors have been secured to aid in clearing land to allow for better roads."
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_islan:0 " Little Citadels"
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_islan_desc:0 "The islands have long been neglected infrastructure wise. With the leering gaze of the gaijin and the treacherous eyes of the Kyushu Naval Junta lingering on the islands under our control we have to prepare them to hold out on their own. Once the coral is cleared out some roads and runways can be built so each of them can defend themselves until reinforcements can be deployed."
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_east:0 "Northern Roads…"
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_east_desc:0 "To better fortify the north we will need more roads to allow for better transportation of concrete and steel. Once the caterpillars are done flattening out an area, the asphalt can be poured out for the roads. Then the real work can begin on fortifying and preparing the north."
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_central:0 "…All Lead To Chugoku"
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_central_desc:0 "Central Chugoku needs work as well. For too long the inland areas have been neglected, passed off as worthless. But if we can turn the hills into roads then it could be turned into a nexus for supply."
 CHU_fishing_vessel_industry:0 "Sally Ports On The Sea"
 CHU_fishing_vessel_industry_desc:0 "While we don’t have many naval experts most of the remaining experts have insisted on building a port on the isles so we can have a base not too far off the sea. In addition to allowing for better transport the isle it would also allow for us to build a bigger navy. Since most of the navy sided with Yamamoto this would be especially valuable."
 CHU_to_build_a_navy:0 "A New And Better Navy"
 CHU_to_build_a_navy_desc:0 "After the treachery of the navy we were left with only a few ships and even fewer loyal naval officers. Due to this we have been forced into trying to build a new navy. The only good news is that we can build this new navy in the image of the army leadership. If we even bother with making it a navy. Why not keep it in the Army?"
 CHU_to_new:0 "Blows To The Nose"
 CHU_to_new_desc:0 "By focusing on battleship design we can create better battleships. Battleships that can smash aside the enemy fleets in the decisive battle and allow our landing ships to disembark their men. Or something like that. The artillery department is really fond of big guns. Besides, size matters."
 CHU_to_build_a_navy_docyard:0 "Army Quality Shipyards"
 CHU_to_build_a_navy_docyard_desc:0 "To better facilitate the construction of our new fleet a new shipyard is needed. We’re doing our best to keep it as secret as possible, as much as a giant building project on the coast can be kept secret. But we’re confident and excited for the army’s new shipyard. Or is it the navy’s?"
 CHU_to_new2:0 "Daggers Beneath"
 CHU_to_new2_desc:0 "No matter how much we may dream of a fleet of battleships under the banner of the army there is no realistic way we can produce battleships of the quantity or quality needed to batter destroy our enemy’s fleets or their shipping. But by taking the lessons of the Germans submarine campaign during the Great War and improving upon it we can starve out our rivals. If the enemy can’t get fuel for their battleships they might as well not have battleships. Who knows? Maybe we can even sink some proper warships."
 CHU_shipbuilding_on_the_islands:0 "Hiroshima Submarine Pens"
 CHU_shipbuilding_on_the_islands_desc:0 "To get as many submarines as we need we will need a base that can not only produce the ships but also protect them. To this end the junta has procured some via contacts with the Mitsubishi company to aid in building these new shipyards."

 CHU_ideological_army_design:0 "An Army For All Of Japan"
 CHU_ideological_army_design_desc:0 "To be a Japanese soldier it is not enough to simply be strong or brave. To be a soldier of the Japanese Army is to despise death and the gaijin. To be a Japanese soldier is to hate with all one’s might all of Japan’s enemies, from within and without. Throughout Japan’s history the Japanese soldier has been the one thing that keeps Japan away from utter chaos."
 CHU_military_factory1:0 "Heroic Capitalism"
 CHU_military_factory1_desc:0 "As loathesome as the capitalist is, they have their uses. By offering favorable deals and rights to some of the zaibatsu we can gain an advantage in resources and free up our own men to actually fight."
 CHU_military_factory2:0 "An Economy Fit For An Army"
 CHU_military_factory2_desc:0 "Among many there seems to be a mistake that the army is meant to protect the economy. The truth of the matter is that the economy, just as how the soldier must serve his country, must serve the army. Our army must have no shortages. If all aspects of the economy are shifted to suit this need then so be it."
 CHU_army_academy:0 "A Proper Japanese Academy"

 CHU_we_are_enough_desc:0 "The more the junta has learned about the doctrine of fascism the more they have found themselves respecting it’s tenants. Of course the Italian model won’t work here.

 CHU_fascist_volunteers:0 "More Rods For Our Bundle"
 CHU_fascist_volunteers_desc:0 "It’s difficult to not notice the similarities between the ideology of the junta and fascism. Though we’ve yet to call ourselves anything close to that until now.

 CHU_ally_other_facist:0 "Dark Oceans For A Dark Time"
 CHU_ally_other_facist_desc:0 "In these dark times the junta needs as many patriots as possible if Japan is to be saved from the chaos of democracy and the evil of communism.

 CHU_ally_facist_SHI:0 "A Temporary Rod"
 CHU_ally_facist_SHI_desc:0 "As infuriating as it is that our junta keeps getting compared to the madmen in Shikoku there may be a sliver of truth in that line of thinking. While we are not in favor of an emperor, since that may limit the military, the State of Shikoku doesn’t know that completely. By posing as fellow-travellers we can arrange a temporary alliance so we can deal with the rest of the wretches."

 CHU_prepare_to_destroy_the_neighbors_desc:0 "For all of the dreams the junta has for Japan one of the resources most required to pursue the unification of the nation is not found within our borders.

Vast amounts of silk and other luxuries found within our nation in return for oil."

 CHU_reinforce_our_northern_borders_desc:0 "With the evolution of the junta and its rhetoric the  People’s Republic of Tohoku are bound to have eyed us with more concern. In the event that they attempt to launch a pre-emptive assault we must have fortresses to counter them. Landmines against men and tanks are being sent north as well as more barbed wire and heavy machine guns. Hopefully the killing fields created can buy any of our reinforcements time to prepare and provide a way to whittle down the red’s numbers."

 CHU_our_communist_workers:0 "Soldiers As The Model Proletarian"
 CHU_our_communist_workers_desc:0 "The more one learns of soldiers the more it becomes obvious that the soldier is the ultimate form of worker and the military is the perfect engine for communism. All are not all soldiers equal aside from what they have earned? Are soldiers not loyal to one another as brothers? This places them above the peasant and the factory worker, both of whom are prone to turn on each other during strikes. Why should the soldier not be the model for society?"

Japan must become communist if it is to be free of the chains of the gaijin bourgeois. To that end we must all unite or die!"
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_democratic_socialism:0 "Not Too Democratic But Socialistic Enough"
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_democratic_socialism_desc:0 "As ridiculous as the idea of democratic socialism is it is still socialism. To aid in the pursuit of communism we ought to provide aid to the ‘democratic socialist’ states and hopefully help them get rid of the democratic part."
 CHU_send_weapons:0 "Guns to The Roses"
 CHU_send_weapons_desc:0 "“With some of the crises currently facing the socialist government in Ezo we ought to provide some aid. While they may lack guns we have some to spare. A shipment should arrive soon to help our socialist allies out."
 CHU_send_volunteers:0 "Send The Military Assistance Group To Edo"
 CHU_send_volunteers_desc:0 "To further aid Ezo in the defense of the revolution on the island the junta has decided to send a group of advisors to aid Ezo. They should be able to help train Ezo’s defenders and assist in planning. And naturally if they have to defend themselves they can. It just so happens the limitations are limited."
 CHU_deal_EZO:0 "Hiroshima-Sapporo Axis"
 CHU_deal_EZO_desc:0 "Just as how for centuries Japan revolved on the axis of Tokyo and the North, now shall Japan revolve around the Axis of Chugoku and Ezo. One shall be the sword, the other the pen. With this coalition there can be no stopping the revolution. Upon this agreement Japan shall be brought to communism."
 CHU_industrial_help_EZO:0 "Friends With Industrial Benefits"
 CHU_industrial_help_EZO_desc:0 "Ezo’s economy is currently lagging behind. Recently their leadership sent a message to Hiroshima asking for aid. Naturally we shall help our fellow Japanese. We need a strong northern ally after all."
 CHU_war_industrial_help_EZO:0 "Dummy’s Guide To War Industry, Ezo Edition"
 CHU_war_industrial_help_EZO_desc:0 "For all of the spirit of the people of Ezo their war industry is still lacking. To rectify this a delegation of logisticians and experts are to be sent from Hiroshima to help Ezo build up the facilities necessary to arm their forces."
 CHU_communist_workers_send_EZO:0 "How Many Communists Does It Take To Tighten A Bolt?"
 CHU_communist_workers_send_EZO_desc:0 "Despite the dreams for communism in Ezo the sad fact of the matter is that there just isn’t much industrial experience in Ezo, if any at all. To rectify this issue and ease up the amount of aid needed for Ezo a group of workers from Hiroshima is to go and help Ezo to teach its population how to work wrench and if needed get some work done there as well."
 CHU_destroy_FER:0 "Abort The Substitutionist State"
 CHU_destroy_FER_desc:0 "The idea of communism is the liberation of all classes into the working class. The mere existence of a political party that holds the power is prone to corruption. Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the so-called Worker’s Republics. For the dignity of communism they must be destroyed!"
 CHU_reate_autonomous_governments:0 "A Truly Feudal Age"
 CHU_reate_autonomous_governments_desc:0 "In spite of all it’s claims of unity and brotherhood in arms the internal feuding within the junta has reached a boiling point. Officers are openly fighting each other, and pay has become scarce for some of the men. As a result some of the old clans have found themselves in a position to absorb the men and use them in their private armies. From here on out, if the junta wants to get anything done it will have to be done with the consent of the clans"
 CHU_clan_OIK:0 "Heirs of the Western Shogun"
 CHU_clan_OIK_desc:0 "The Okayama Ikeda have managed to absorb enough men to assert their ‘rights.’ From here on out we will have to deal with them. Hopefully they live up to their illustrious ancestor Ikeda Terumasa and help reunify the nation."
 CHU_clan_TMA:0 "Blue Matsudairas"
 CHU_clan_TMA_desc:0 "The Tsuyama Matsudaira have gathered a host of warriors, many of whom deserters with their old kit, outside their old hold in Tsuyama. This host, while not the largest of them, do have a fortress which will particularly hard to crack. They insist that they shall protect their people. Hopefully they are content with that."
 CHU_clan_IKE:0 "Another Ōkanehira"
 CHU_clan_IKE_desc:0 "The Ikeda of Totori have just seceded as well around their old stomping grounds. Let us see if they can use the sword as well as their ancestor."
 CHU_clan_MAT:0 "Red Matsudairas"
 CHU_clan_MAT_desc:0 "The descendants of the great tea master have occupied Matsue Castle once again. They have promised the peasants there that they shall restore prosperity to the domain just as Harusato did."
 CHU_clan_AMA:0 "Heirs Of The Temple Builder"
 CHU_clan_AMA_desc:0 "The Kamei Clan has taken up arms again. They promise that just as how Kamei Koremasa helped Kōdai-ji so too shall they help rebuild the region. What they left out of that promise, of course, was the fee."
 CHU_clan_ABE:0 "Return Of Perry’s Door Knobs"
 CHU_clan_ABE_desc:0 "Somehow the Abe Clan has convinced a group of soldiers and peasants that they can protect them. They profess how they wish to atone for the role their ancestor Abe Masahiro played in signing the Convention of Kanagawa."
 CHU_clan_ASO:0 "Return Of The Magistrate’s Heirs"
 CHU_clan_ASO_desc:0 "The Amano Clan has returned and has claimed a chunk of land for themselves. They swear that just as how Amano Yasukage helped bring stability to Mikawa so too shall they."
 CHU_clan_UCC:0 "How Many Clans Are there?"
 CHU_clan_UCC_desc:0 "Somehow even the minor clans are getting in on the game. In Bitchu a confederation has formed comprised of smaller clans so as to counteract the power of the other clans. Calling themselves the United Clans of Bitchu this confederacy’s self-delcared mission is to protect the stability of Bishu and all the clans."
 CHU_clan_management_0:0 "Ministry of Clan Relations"
 CHU_clan_management_0_desc:0 "While the clans are de facto independent they insist that their private armies are just to ensure order. As tempting as it is to send in our troops, hang the deserters, and burn down the manors the junta’s resources are too few and the external enemies are too great. So we’re left with trying to negotiate. For this purpose the Ministry of Clan Relations has been established to mediate disputes and coordinate with them."
 CHU_select_ideology:0 "An Ideology To Unite The Clans"
 CHU_select_ideology_desc:0 "While the clans are mighty they still must abide by some regulations. Of course to keep them loyal to the junta an ideology must be adopted by which we can unite the clans."
 CHU_select_comunist:0 "Clans As The New Communes"
 CHU_select_comunist_desc:0 "As absurd as it is somehow communism has been the decided ideology. By creating requirements for clan heirs that appear to make sense to the clans we can ease the clans down the road of communist thinking. Many times through out Japanese history daimyos have adopted children who then became daimyo. We’re reaching but it’s all we can really think of to explain the idea."
 CHU_select_fascist:0 "Revive The Three Arrows"
 CHU_select_fascist_desc:0 "Every child knows the story of Mori Motonoroi’s arrows. A single arrow can be easily broken, but three arrows bound together are strong. It’s hard not to see the link to fascism. By adopting the symbolism of Mori’s three arrows we can hopefully unite the clans."
 CHU_select_democrat:0 "United Clan Republic"
 CHU_select_democrat_desc:0 "As absurd as it sounds we could try to utilize republicanism to try to resolve the disputes. By guaranteeing the rights of each clan and having elections it can create a structure by which the clans feel comfortable working in and ensuring the peasants don’t feel neglected."
 CHU_spread_ideology_to_clans:0 "Distribute The Proper Thinking To The Clans"
 CHU_spread_ideology_to_clans_desc:0 "Moment of truth. We’ll begin sending out delegates to inform the clans of our chosen ideology and hope they accept it. Hope and pray they accept it."
 CHU_intagrate_puppets:0 "A New Sankin Kotai"
 CHU_intagrate_puppets_desc:0 "There’s been some grumbling among the clans. It’s becoming increasingly clear that unless we act quickly the junta will face a full rebellion from the clans. Thankfully we have an idea. Just as how the shogunate demanded the daimyos keep residences in Edo and either have themselves or their families stay there the clans remained loyal. When that system broke down the Boshin War began. We’ll do our best to accommodate our guests."
 CHU_join_the_comunists:0 "Workers of Japan, Unite!"
 CHU_join_the_comunists_desc:0 "With the clans pacified we can finally join the other socialist states of Japan. While we can’t agree to unify under a single nation we can certainly unite in alliance to destroy the reactionary dogs."
 CHU_join_the_fascist:0 "Many Swords, United In A Bundle"
 CHU_join_the_fascist_desc:0 "In this violent age only violence can bring peace, but nor can we stand alone. To this end we shall join states such as Shikoku in a coalition. We shall see Japan united again. As Motonari’s sons were united, so too shall Japan."
 CHU_change_ruling_party:0 "Old Ideas, New Elections"
 CHU_change_ruling_party_desc:0 "It’s time to test how well the ideas have gone. We’ll hold elections to determine clan heirs, representation in the legislature and who shall lead the new presidency."
 CHU_war_preparation:0 "Ready The Sashimono"
 CHU_war_preparation_desc:0 "Now that we are at peace with ourselves we must prepare for the war to come. We must begin stockpiling weapons and ammunition, drawing up plans, training men. Nothing must be left to chance. Raise high the banners"
 CHU_invite_democrats:0 "Freedom, Old Families And New Friends"
 CHU_invite_democrats_desc:0 "With the elections settled we can begin reaching out to other republics in Japan. For this purpose some of the clans extended families can be quite useful. While we cannot unite under a single republic yet, we can unite in our disdain for the fascist and the communist."
 CHU_create_democrat_faction:0 "Japanese Liberty Front"
 CHU_create_democrat_faction_desc:0 "As cheesy as the name is it fits. We’ve already convinced some of the more well connected clans in the other republics to assist us in forming this alliance. With this coalition the darkness of fascism and the lies of socialism can be driven out of Japan once and for all!"
 CHU_liberate_puppets:0 "Private Property, The Most Basic Right Of All"
 CHU_liberate_puppets_desc:0 "“Every day the clans of Chugoku here about the deprivations faced by clans in other states. To this end they have come forth demanding war to liberate the other clans. This could be useful in creating new allies and gaining the support of the clans in general. On the other hand this has been forced upon us."
 CHU_continue_with_junta:0 "Warrior Government For Warrior Clans"
 CHU_continue_with_junta_desc:0 "Since the resurgence of the clans many have suggested adopting an ideology to unite them. However the junta has come to the conclusion that as warriors the clans will have the most respect for a warrior-based government. And so the junta remains."
 CHU_puppets_get_closer:0 "Bring The Whole Families Together"
 CHU_puppets_get_closer_desc:0 "To prevent inter-clan conflict and rebellion against the junta a series of protocols are to be in place. First will be a series of hostage exchanges so no single clan would risk aggression against another lest their kin pay the price. Second will be a series of marriages. While old fashioned it’s worked before and nothing is as terrifying as an angry wife."
 CHU_create_new_faction:0 "Stability Coalition"
 CHU_create_new_faction_desc:0 "This time of chaos benefits no one. No one but the evil. Stability must be restored. Rivals won’t become friends but they will put aside their differences. For now the thing that matters most is Japan. The details of ideology must be put aside until the chaos is over."
 CHU_invite_junta:0 "Olive Branch For The Navy?"
 CHU_invite_junta_desc:0 "While interservice rivalry has always existed few nations can say their branches hate each other more than the Japanese Army and Navy hate each other. Ever since the end of the Boshin War one has been neglected while the other received praise. But right now the rivalry must be put on hold. The military junta has been dispatched an emissary to ask Yamamot and the naval junta for a temporary truce. As long as Japan is in chaos the men whom it is supposed to look to cannot fight. That can come later."
 CHU_join_other_junta:0 "End The Rivalry"
 CHU_join_other_junta_desc:0 "The military is supposed to defend its nation of origin. But how can it do that when its branches are at war? For countless years the army and navy have hated each other. And Japan has paid the price. As long as this petty feud lasts there can be no hope of peace in Japan. This must end. The junta has approved a message to Yamamoto, offering peace and unity for Japan. All branches of the nation shall be equal."
 CHU_war_preparation_3:0 "Begin Joint-Planning"
 CHU_war_preparation_3_desc:0 "With the rivalry between the army and navy put aside the true work can begin. Intel is to be shared freely, plans coordinated, and supplies prepared. This chaos cannot go on much longer. For the good of the nation."
 CHU_war_with_juntas:0 "Old Habits Die Hard"
 CHU_war_with_juntas_desc:0 "We were wrong. There can be no such thing as making amends with the naval junta. Only chaos. This rivalry must end. One way or another."
 CHU_war_with_fascists:0 "Operation Chosokabe"
 CHU_war_with_fascists_desc:0 "The time has come to deal with the Shikoku State. As long as they continue to exist they serve as a beacon for the most deranged of mad men. We must remove them quickly, lest they put their insane ideas into practice."
 CHU_clans_developt:0 "Military-Clan-Industrial Complex"
 CHU_clans_developt_desc:0 "A benefit of the return of the clans is their funds. By coordinating investments in joint funds we can begin utilizing them to build up infrastructure throughout Chugoku."
 CHU_clans_developt_military:0 "Modern Tanegashima"
 CHU_clans_developt_military_desc:0 "By the time of Sekigahara Japan had one of the most advanced militaries in the world, with some of the finest generals and equipment around, such that even the Europeans were less than us. So it shall be again. We shall license out some of our designs to the clans and help them build their gun industry."
 CHU_clans_developt_military_2:0 "New Cavalry For Old Clans"
 CHU_clans_developt_military_2_desc:0 "The origin of the samurai lay with cavalry. Before the Mongols the Samurai were primarily horse archers. And the key to the future of the clans lies in cavalry. However instead of using horses, they shall instead use trucks and tanks."
 CHU_clans_developt_infrustracture:0 "Clan Rail Services"
 CHU_clans_developt_infrustracture_desc:0 "To prevent different rail gauges from being used in different clan territories we ought to coordinate with the clans. There is also a benefit to the clans owning rail lines. Perhaps we could decorate tourist trains with more traditional art. The gaijin seem to find Japanese art bizarre but beautiful. Perhaps we could use this to our advantage."
 CHU_clans_developt_infrustracture_2:0 "Clan-Approved Roads"
 CHU_clans_developt_infrustracture_2_desc:0 "As proven by the usage of Trucks by the allies in the Great War there is an advantage to trucks that cannot be found in rails. While they may demand less cost and maintenance they still require some maintenance. For this purpose a road coordination board is to be set up to assist in planning and maintaining roads in clan owned lands."
 CHU_clans_developt_civilian:0 "Righty Tighty"
 CHU_clans_developt_civilian_desc:0 "For all of the wealth of the clans the sad thing is many are still living in 1870 in terms of technology. To help with this, volunteers are to gathered to help the clans properly set up factories so they don’t immediately fall apart."
 CHU_clans_developt_civilian_2:0 "Lefty Loosey"
 CHU_clans_developt_civilian_2_desc:0 "As easy as it is to simply say ‘build the factories for the clans’ the reality is that unless there is an understanding of engineering among the populace there is always going to be a serious lack of progress made in industry. To that end industrial schools are being planned and simple books are being printed to help the peasants living in clan territories how to perform basic maintenance."
 CHU_clans_technology_sharing_program:0 "Create The Tanaka Program"
 CHU_clans_technology_sharing_program_desc:0 "To better coordinate and share technology with the clans a program has been set up via the University of Hiroshima. Calling itself the Tanaka Program, the brilliant engineer and Karakuri puppet maker, this program will help in sharing technology between the junta and the clans."
 CHU_clans_research_program:0 " Found the Ōshima Initiative"
 CHU_clans_research_program_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts the research and education programs of the clans is still lacking. Again, Hiroshima University has come forth with a new program. Named after the inventor-samurai Ōshima Takatō, the Ōshima Initiative’s objective is to foster learning and engineering in rural areas. While there are certainly urban areas under clan suzereinity most are rural and so the Ōshima Initiative is almost tailor made for this situation."
 CHU_make_a_new_country:0 "New Country For An Ancient Land"
 CHU_make_a_new_country_desc:0 "Samurai. Tanks. Honor. Nuclear science. In this chaotic mixture of all it is hard to find where one is without going mad. But one thing is clear. For Japan to survive it must adapt. It must progress. It must accelerate."
 CHU_change_in_party:0 "New Organization For The New State"
 CHU_change_in_party_desc:0 "The old system will not work. There must be a new way of things. This is near universal for Japanese affairs in general. This is especially true for the junta. We must seek a proper organization, one which espouses the proper values of militarism but allows for wiggle room for innovation to be made."
 CHU_Chugoku_federal_government:0 "Japanese Federalism"
 CHU_Chugoku_federal_government_desc:0 "With the return of the clans and the decentralization of power Chugoku can no longer be called a state but with its organization and unity it cannot be called a confederacy either. From hence forth the Federal State of Chugoku shall endeavor to restore order to Japan and bring the islands to a glorious future."
 CHU_expand_federal_government:0 "The Annexation Of The Islands"
