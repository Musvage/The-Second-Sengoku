 # Focuses
 CHU_assess_our_situation:0 "Fukoku kyōhei"
 CHU_assess_our_situation_desc:0 "While the initial restoration of peace has fallen apart we must not lose heart and think strategically. First we must understand our supply, morale, and training situation. Only with the proper understanding of our situation can the junta make corrections and begin the path to restoring Japan."
 CHU_air_doctrin:0 "The Wings of the Sun"
 CHU_air_doctrin_desc:0 "Among the findings it has been determined that our aerial tactics are outmoded. The advent of radio has meant that now we can communicate more effectively and coordinate better. No more is aerial combat about dueling, now it is about coordination and positioning. We must take into account these changes and make adjustments for the good of our pilots and our army."
 CHU_build_Kugun:0 "New Branch, Old Nation"
 CHU_build_Kugun_desc:0 "The more we look into the facts of aerial combat the more we have realized both the critical role it will play and the different thinking needed. Just as how in naval combat one cannot use army techniques, neither can navy nor army techniques be applied to air combat. To better resolve these new issues and supply our aerial assets a new branch is needed."
 CHU_build_Kugun2:0 "Modern Kamikaze"
 CHU_build_Kugun2_desc:0 "While we may find ourselves in a land war for now we must remember where our true enemies are, how they will come to us, and how we must punish them. By blasting the gaijin's transports we can ensure that another Patey expedition would suffer the same fate as the Mongols when they attempted to invade the mainland."
 CHU_build_Kugun3:0 "Cut Their Tendons"
 CHU_build_Kugun3_desc:0 "While no war can be won by air alone it can certainly aid in destroying an enemy. With the range and vantage point offered by planes we can utilize our aircraft as flying artillery against the enemy on the field and by burning their factories down. No army can win on an empty stomach, and by destroying their supply lines we can starve them out."
 CHU_build_Kugun5:0 "New Branch, Newer Planes"
 CHU_build_Kugun5_desc:0 "For our air force to operate properly we need modern equipment. Just as our army needs the finest rifles, so too does our air force need the finest planes. A perfect balance of firepower, speed, maneuverability, and cost. It's faults must be zero."
 CHU_build_Kugun6:0 "Hatchery for the Dragons"
 CHU_build_Kugun6_desc:0 "As eager as our pilots are, our air force is not yet ready. For all our ambitions for our air force we do not yet have enough planes to serve our needs. More factories are needed and we must create an enthusiasm for air design so we can keep up. To this end the junta has drawn up plans to open up numerous plans for new plane factories. By the time we are through, Japan will truly be the rising sun of aviation."
 CHU_open_political_sphere:0 "One nation, one Army"
 CHU_open_political_sphere_desc:0 "The junta has managed to hold itself together and avoid splintering. We fight for Japan and it's glorious future. But some still wonder what that future entails? We should deal with this soon. Just because the men were appeased now does not mean they will be a second time"
 CHU_increase_civillian_influence:0 "The Ballot, Not the Katana"
 CHU_increase_civillian_influence_desc:0 "It has been a long and bloody lesson but one the junta has learned. Just as how the katana needs the man, the general needs the politician. Nor can so much power be entrusted to so few as a royal family or a party. It needs to be dispersed. We shall bring forth a new constitution, one for our soldiers to fight for, and to guide our nation."
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_democracy:0 "Soldier Democracy"
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_democracy_desc:0 "This new republic shall be a true one. One not imposed by a foreign power. Not dominated by a single province. Not dictated by a city. Ours shall be a republic of strength, forged by the common ties of culture and shared sacrifice. Japan shall be led by a republic, founded on the sweat and tears of soldiers, and for their families."
 CHU_ally_PRO:0 "Coalition for Freedom"
 CHU_ally_PRO_desc:0 "We are not the only ones who wish to see a free Japan. There are others who share this dream. While we may not agree on every issue what we can agree on is that we must unite. Unite or die. Until then the minute details of government structure can wait."
 CHU_make_a_new_front:0 " United in Dreams"
 CHU_make_a_new_front_desc:0 "After long talks it has been agreed upon in the senate to reach out to other republican factions in Japan to form an alliance to bring peace to the nation. While we will likely bleed from our ears arguing over which provinces get how many seats and what is amended in the constitution, or if we will have to adopt a new one, it's better than bleeding in a ditch."
 CHU_take_seto_island:0 "From Threat to Redoubt"
 CHU_take_seto_island_desc:0 "Seto is vital to the continued safety of Chugoku. Vital as both a threat to our safety, and as a redoubt on the sea. By hook or by crook the island must be secured for the continued safety of our new republic."
 CHU_destroy_fleet:0 "The End of Yamamoto"
 CHU_destroy_fleet_desc:0 "When the chaos began in 1930 the navy tried to form its own junta. While this far from unexpected the treachery of Yamamoto was still stinigng. And now with an actual republic for them to fight for they instead dally and say that the republic is a puppet state for the army. For this reason alone Yamamoto and his dogs must die. All of them."
 CHU_destroy_SHI:0 "Crush the Fanatics"
 CHU_destroy_SHI_desc:0 "With every breath they draw the lunatics in charge of so-called ‘Government of the Japanese Empire’ take more innocents suffer and more similarly deranged men look to their ideology as some sort of inspiration. We must bring an end to this madness quickly. Quickly and harshly."
 CHU_spread_democracy_neighbors_01:0 "Torchbearers of Democracy"
 CHU_spread_democracy_neighbors_01_desc:0 "It is not enough to simply destroy the armies of the oppressors of Japan. We must destroy all the oppressors were, every tenant of their vile ideologies turned to ash. For Japan to be free from foreign deprivations first its people must be free and unified. The unification has begun!"
 CHU_spread_democracy_for_shi:0 "Operation Honnō-ji"
 CHU_spread_democracy_for_shi_desc:0 "It’s time to bring democracy to Shigoku. The plans are drawn up, contingency plans made ready, the troops are fed, and the vehicles are fueled. We will overwhelm the lunatics with firepower before disembarking our troops. Once the beachheads are secure the fight shouldn’t be too hard."
 CHU_spread_democracy_for_kyu:0 "Operation Sun-Nashi"
 CHU_spread_democracy_for_kyu_desc:0 "We’re ready, as ready as we’ll ever be. Every day that passes the Naval Junta increases the size of its fleets. We’ve caught up for now but we need to move quickly. As soon as our men land they need to ensure they have the airfields so we can fly in supplies and reinforcements. That done we can begin work on taking the ports. It won’t be easy but we need to get this done now."
 CHU_invite_new_democrat_states:0 "The Hiroshima Convention"
 CHU_invite_new_democrat_states_desc:0 "It’s time to speak with the other democratic factions. We shall send out delegates and officials to the other little republics. There they can invite them all to a meeting in Hiroshima. There we shall drink sake and discuss the future of our nation under a Japanese republic and what that will look like."
 CHU_annex_denmocratic_states_kyu:0 "The New Province, Kyushu"
 CHU_annex_denmocratic_states_kyu_desc:0 "The time has come to welcome Kyushu into the fold. As a Province of the Japanese Republic Kyushu shall have a representation in the senate and the house. The seats shall be appointed according to the number of people who voted for each party or candidate so as to prevent regionalism. We welcome Kyushu as a new and equal state in our new republic."
 CHU_annex_denmocratic_states_shi:0 "The New Province, Shigoku"
 CHU_annex_denmocratic_states_shi_desc:0 ""
 CHU_unite_all_faction_members:0 "Unite All Faction Members"
 CHU_unite_all_faction_members_desc:0 ""
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_monarchy:0 "People's Shogunate"
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_monarchy_desc:0 "For all its faults the Tokugawa Clan brought with them centuries of peace and created the culture Japan currently has. If we are to win the people must have a voice. But what is the point of them all having a voice if they have no unifying identity? For this dilemma we can bring in a Tokugawa member and proclaim them shogun in return for them signing a constitution."
 CHU_ally_SHO:0 "Contact Shogunal Realists"
 CHU_ally_SHO_desc:0 "For our project to succeed we will need aid from more shogunal allies. Allies who are realistic about the modern world. For this we shall begin sending out agents to invite them to the new shogunate to provide aid. Hopefully we can get aid to not only help structure the new legislature and court."
 CHU_Create_New_Empire:0 "New Empire, Old Country"
 CHU_Create_New_Empire_desc:0 "More and more it becomes clearer and clearer the glory of our empire. A fusion of old and new. Discipline and freedom. East and west. Tradition and progress. We have found the happy marriage of all these in our new Japan. All that remains now is to help those few chained by despots and demagogues open their eyes."
 CHU_recruit_volunteers:0 "Oyakata-sama's Youth Corps"
 CHU_recruit_volunteers_desc:0 "As a result of the shogun's personal endeavors a new paramilitary group has formed. Calling themselves 'Oyakata-sama's Youth Corps,' this group teaches life skills and prepares them for military service. With camping, sports, and other such things as well as medals it has become quite useful for recruiting new volunteers as it already teaches them some of the more basic skills."
 CHU_support_shinzo_hamais_policies:0 "The Hamei Reforms"
 CHU_support_shinzo_hamais_policies_desc:0 "Mayor Hamei has been a bastion of fine leadership in these dark times. Under his tenure Hiroshima has become a beacon of stability in a sea of chaos. Some are suggesting that we take some of his policies and apply them at a regional level. And once Japan is united once more then the Hamei Reforms can help all of Japan."
 CHU_sanchi_iron_sand1:0 "Iron Corporation, Steel Country"
 CHU_sanchi_iron_sand1_desc:0 "More and more we find ourselves in need of more and more steel. However few of the junta’s own staff have experience in mining. By sponsoring and subsidizing an iron corporation with incentives to maximize the output of iron we can solve some of this issue. Naturally we shall have a stake in this company."
 CHU_hiroshima_university2:0 "Try New Things, Do New Things"
 CHU_hiroshima_university2_desc:0 "Just as how the boot camp makes boys into soldiers, so too does the university make boys into doctors. And in this day and age of rapid advancement we must encourage a spirit of innovation so we can catch up. By sponsoring Hiroshima University and its activities we can help close the gap alongside a campaign of innovation."
 CHU_Unite_All_Japan_People:0 "One Nation, One People"
 CHU_Unite_All_Japan_People_desc:0 "Countless times in history leaders claim to have united their people. All too often this unity fades the second the leader draws their last breath. Many have been called the unifiers of Japan only for the fissures to remain. We cannot reunify Japan. That implies it was unified before. We shall unify Japan for the first time in its long and beautiful history, by ballot, by arms, by leadership."
 CHU_monarchist_technology_sharing:0 "National Scientific Alliance"
 CHU_monarchist_technology_sharing_desc:0 "Two heads are better than one. That is how the old saying goes. So we shall have more minds. We shall share our knowledge to our fellow restorationists and in turn receive their knowledge. Under the guise of the ‘National Scientific Alliance’ we shall catch up to the enemy’s technological level and, perhaps, create a unified college system."
 CHU_monarchist_industry:0 "Daishō"
 CHU_monarchist_industry_desc:0 "For the sake of Japan we must put aside our differences with the other restorationists. Just as how a samurai cannot use his weapons if they have broken themselves upon each other nor can the shogun be restored if all of his followers have killed each other over the privilege of being the sole party responsible for his return. We can argue later. For now we must be at peace with the other restorationists."
 CHU_civilian_universty:0 "A Left Hand"
 CHU_civilian_universty_desc:0 "Even if our army is the right hand of the republic, we still need a left hand. It doesn’t matter how strong the right hand is, it needs a twin to help even if the other is weak. To this end there must be enlightened individuals to aid in uniting our nation and keeping it unified. By assisting civil universities we can ensure a new generation of patriotic and brilliant civilians to be the nation’s left hand."
 CHU_moderate_voice:0 "A Calm But Firm Voice"
 CHU_moderate_voice_desc:0 "To keep a semblance of stability some ground needs to be ceded on both sides. Of course the issue of how much ground is given by each is the issue. For this reason the junta should try to present itself not as commanders in the political arena but as a neutral party so as to provide an ear for politicians to arbitrate their disputes without bringing in the courts. And if it means that the army can get more funds from this arrangement then it’s all the better"
 CHU_limited_democracy:0 "Democracy Guided By Soldiers"
 CHU_limited_democracy_desc:0 "By allowing elections and some freedoms we can make the common man feel like he has a voice. Of course the army will be ready to provide arbitration as a neutral party. And if the politicians cannot make decisions we have provision in place to allow the junta to undertake actions they feel are necessary in the absence of clear orders from the government"
 CHU_conserve_the_status_quo:0 "An Army With A Nation"
 CHU_conserve_the_status_quo_desc:0 "The political situation for Chugoku has not changed. There shall be no shogun. No emperor. No elections. Japan shall serve the soldiers who defend it. In this world peace is an anomaly. Life itself is war. Why should this not be reflected in government and society? From here on out all of Chogoku are soldiers in one way or another."
 CHU_decentralize_the_junta:0 "Decentralized Command For Better Command"
 CHU_decentralize_the_junta_desc:0 "In the initial days of the coup the junta micromanaged the army too heavily and as such too many soldiers either paid with their lives or deserted. To avoid a similar tragedy a second time the junta has agreed to grant more autonomy to the men under their command. That includes the non-combatants."
 CHU_sanyo_fishing_industry:0 "Emergency Naval Proclamation No. 8891"
 CHU_sanyo_fishing_industry_desc:0 "Ever since the old navy under Yamamoto betrayed the military and started its own state we have lacked a proper navy to counter the threat posed by other states. Thankfully the San’yo area is well known for its fishing industry and there are several shipyards we could convert so they could construct warships. As such the Navy has issued a mass requisition order, transferring ownership of all shipyards to the navy. The former owners of the shipyards shall be compensated in the future with interest."
 CHU_build_yamato_class:0 "Birth The Navy Killer"
 CHU_build_yamato_class_desc:0 "Even with the requisition of the shipyards and the heroic efforts of our shipbuilders the fact of the matter is that our new navy will forever be outnumbered. When we fight the Kyushu Naval Junta we shall be out-numbered, and when we face the gaijin we will be outnumbered. What we need is a fleet killer. Hence why we shall build a new battleship class. One that will crush all enemy navies regardless of the odds. We shall call this class the ‘Yamato."
 CHU_trade_deal:0 "Iron for Fuel"
 CHU_trade_deal_desc:0 "As sickening as the gaijin are we still must trade with them since we lack the oil and food necessary to fuel our vehicles and men. Thankfully our mines are plentiful in most supplies. For now we shall exchange resources we have in excess for what we need. Hopefully we won’t have to take too long."
 CHU_boost_morale_to_the_army:0 "Giving It All For The Saviors of Japan"
 CHU_boost_morale_to_the_army_desc:0 "Since the coup began many of our men have wondered why they fight against imperial or republican forces. We must remind them of their importance. From here on out all soldiers shall receive benefits, housing aid for them and their families, better mail lines so they can talk to them, a dedicated brothel service to scratch their itches, and an entire month dedicated to the common soldier. We must spare no expense in making sure the soldier knows he is appreciated and loved."
 CHU_sanchi_iron_sand:0 "Iron Sand, Iron People"
 CHU_sanchi_iron_sand_desc:0 "Just as how we will use every single one of our soldiers, present or future, to unify Japan so too must we use every single resource we have. Few are more critical than iron. No source, not even the iron sand, can be overlooked. All must be for the upcoming wars. No expense can be spared in preparing Chugoku for what is to come."
 CHU_military_factory3:0 "The Suzuki Strategy"
 CHU_military_factory3_desc:0 "Suzuki has come forward with a proposal to aid in the preparation of Chugoku and Japan in its militarization. They’re ambitious. The junta has agreed to his suggestions and the logisticians are requistioning the required resources as we speak."
 CHU_hiroshima_university:0 "Military Education For A Military Nation"
 CHU_hiroshima_university_desc:0 "It’s easy to write poems about the glories of the soldier duelling his dastardly foe, the glory of the charge, and the camaraderie between soldiers. But the reality is that unless there are officers who can lead those men well it doesn’t matter how brave or skilled those soldiers are. To this end all universities and schools are to begin preparing everyone for service, with special programs in place to foster leadership and fast track them to officer’s academies."
 CHU_invite_new_generals:0 "General Amnesty No. 003a"
 CHU_invite_new_generals_desc:0 "As much as we’d like to pretend that our generals are the finest the fact of the matter is that we are running short on decent generals and there are some officers who, while brilliant as regimental leaders, do not have the mind for larger scale command. And so a general amnesty has been put out, offering amnesty and command to generals who have been exiled to join the junta. Though we will keep an eye on them"
 CHU_Chugoku_Fate:0 "Three Generals Enter A Room…"
 CHU_Chugoku_Fate_desc:0 "In spite of the junta’s best efforts to convince the world otherwise there is still politics in the military. More and more it has become clear that for Japan to become the nation it’s military deserves that it needs a commander-in-chief. To this end three of the top generals have met to discuss the path ahead. Initially. The truth is that as much as the generals may not like to hear it they have more in common professors than they’d like to admit."
 CHU_Tomoyuki_Yamashita_path:0 "… And The Tactician Remains Standing"
 CHU_Tomoyuki_Yamashita_path_desc:0 "Yamashita has emerged victorious from the confrontation. Having secured the rank of dai-gensui, the real work can truly begin. No more standing around. There is work to do."
 CHU_declare_national_hero_Yamashita:0 "A Japanese Napoleon"
 CHU_declare_national_hero_Yamashita_desc:0 "As part of his efforts to secure his place as commander-in-chief, Yamashita has realized the need of propaganda. It is not enough to simply portray him as a great soldier or general. The people must love him. The people must view him as a living embodiment of what a Japanese man should be. A soldier, a patriot, a conqueror. He must be viewed as nothing less than the role model for all of Japan."
 CHU_aggressive_army_order:0 "There Is Only One Direction. Forwards!"
 CHU_aggressive_army_order_desc:0 "Every second not moving is a second wasted. Every second wasted is a victory for the enemy and time for him to fortify and reorganize. There can be no withdrawal, there can be no rest. There must be perpetual motion."
 CHU_enpower_junta:0 "Military Leadership For The Military Nation"
 CHU_enpower_junta_desc:0 "In an announcement it has been declared that Japan shall no longer be led astray by demagogues, inbred idiots or popularity contests. From here on out Japan shall be managed as a military, with the guiding principles of sacrifice and merit. As such there shall be no insubordination of any kind tolerated. We are all soldiers now. There shall be no weakness or cowardice. For as long as there is a single threat to Japan the junta shall remain and shall protect all of Japan!"
 CHU_purge_officers:0 "From Within and Without"
 CHU_purge_officers_desc:0 "t’s no secret that there are elements in the military who oppose the dai-gensui. They seem to believe that if the dai-gensui assumed power why can’t they? This is particularly concerning since some of these men are generals. For this purpose a list has been drawn up of generals and officers who must be ‘removed."
 CHU_Convince_people_to_fight:0 "Raise the flag high! As high as the heavens!"
 CHU_Convince_people_to_fight_desc:0 "The dai-gensui and the rest of the junta has authorized a series of programs to bolster patriotism. By encouraging the production of books and kamishibai depicting the history and glory of Japan, especially of the recent victories, we can increase the enthusiasm of the population. And one cannot forget the parades."
 CHU_destroy_KAN:0 "Smother the Gaijin-Lover"
 CHU_destroy_KAN_desc:0 "In spite of all the reforms taken it’s becoming clearer that even if the dai-gensui is successful that there is an appeal to restoring the old monarchy. And it would provide a nice puppet for the junta to work behind. But Hirohito’s become too tainted by the stink of London. But there’s nothing that enough howitzers can’t clean up."
 CHU_new_emperor:0 "A Modern Minamoto"
 CHU_new_emperor_desc:0 "As brilliant as the dai-gensui and junta are they more and more realize that there was a logic to the old rulers of Japan. Japan needs more than a general. It needs icons. And for all the shogunates faults the ideas of a warrior’s state was beautiful. To that end we require a new Minamoto. Kan'in Kotohito, while not descended from the Minamoto himself, is a member of the Imperial Family. He can serve as a decent figure head to unite all the soldiers."
 CHU_one_emperor:0 "The Junta’s Emperor"
 CHU_one_emperor_desc:0 "While the junta may be united around the dai-gensui, the soldiers united by the shogun, there are still some civillians who feel like they have no figure to hear them. To that end the junta has found a suitable answer. An imperial candidate who will play the part of grandfather to the people. Of course one also wise enough to heed the advice of the junta."
 CHU_create_imperial_allies:0 "The New Imperialist Movement"
 CHU_create_imperial_allies_desc:0 "With our emperor and shogun in place we can begin forming our own coalition to unite Japan. The New Imperialist Movement will unite the other monarchists, shogunal and imperial alike, and under the guidance of the junta will reunite Japan and create a new empire for the Japanese people."
 CHU_imperial_army:0 "New Samurai For A New Era"
 CHU_imperial_army_desc:0 "The newly proclaimed Imperial Japanese Army is ready. They shall be everything and more that the samurai were. They shall be honor, disdain weakness, the perfect warrior in all forms of combat and have the finest of equipment. None shall stand in the way of the true Imperial Japanese Army!"
 CHU_invite_old_shogunate:0 "General Amnesty No. 008c"
 CHU_invite_old_shogunate_desc:0 "As tempting as it is to cut down the old Tokugawa family and all their supporters, unfortunately we still have need for more expertise. And so by offering a general amnesty to the Tokugawa Shogunate’s officials and personnel we can gain more men and resources without needing to spill blood. And should Kan'in Kotohito step out of line we would have a suitable replacement on hand."
 CHU_war_goal_KAN:0 "Death To The False-Emperors!"
 CHU_war_goal_KAN_desc:0 "Despite the elimination of Kansai there are somehow other ‘emperors.’ With each breath these weaklings take the more their patrons gain in followers and resources. We must eliminate these wretches and their masters quickly before too many monarchists and traditionalists have to be eliminated too."
 CHU_war_goal_KYU:0 "Operation Kizugawaguchi"
 CHU_war_goal_KYU_desc:0 "The time has come to put down the naval junta. We’ll see how their precious fleet fairs against our own. Once our men are on the beeches we will have to move efficiently. There must be no mistakes."
 CHU_war_goal_SHI:0 "Operation Ashikaga"
 CHU_war_goal_SHI_desc:0 "It’s time to put the fanatics out of our misery. Every second they keep blabbering about their third way is an aneurysm for the junta."
 CHU_Declare_Imperial_Shogunate_Junta:0 "Proclaim the South Pacified"
 CHU_Declare_Imperial_Shogunate_Junta_desc:0 "It has been a long and painful road but Southern Japan is stable again. We’re preparing to authorize the emperor and his family to go and perform some rituals and ceremonies to celebrate the reunification of the south as we speak."
 CHU_annex_SHO:0 "There Can Be Only One Shogun"
 CHU_annex_SHO_desc:0 "The time has come. We have prepared a letter for the Tokugawa demanding they recognize Kan'in Kotohito as shogun. They’ll most likely refuse, thankfully. It’d be sad to not see the last of the Tokugawa not dragged out of their palaces."
 CHU_relations_of_interest:0 "The Enemies Of Our Enemies…"
 CHU_relations_of_interest_desc:0 "While diplomacy is far from our speciality it should be possible to reach an agreement with some parties.

 CHU_trade_deal_with_friends:0 "Joint Commerce and Prosperity Initiative"
 CHU_trade_deal_with_friends_desc:0 "By offering no tariffs with certain allies we can allow for better and more immediate trade with some allies. This serves two purposes.

 CHU_invite_other_neighbor_desc:0 "While they will need to be dealt with eventually we have reached an accord with some of the other Japanese states. We will ally in a coalition to reunite the nation to expel the last vestiges of democracy, communism, fascism, and gaijins. That is the written part. The unwritten agreement is also that after those four are gone that there will only be one of us left."

We will take Edo back. And with them gone we can wipe away the stains of shame that we have had to bear since the Patey Expedition.

 CHU_alternative_path:0 "A Slight Change In Plans"
 CHU_alternative_path_desc:0 "Despite the initial hope that the decision was final there has been a slight deviation. Once more arguments have broken out between the members of the junta as doubt has once more seized the hearts of the generals. And this time it has prevailed. Japan will need a new way forward if it is to survive. A way that the generals had previously ruled out."

 CHU_Teiichi_Suzuki_become_neutrality_party_leader_desc:0 "As part of Suzuki’s first reforms as commander-in-chief is a slight change in naming. The junta is to form the Japanese Patriot Party so as to present a face of non-bias to the Japanese people and the world. Of course, however, the Japanese Patriot Party is controlled by the army, not the other way around."
 CHU_build_neutrality:0 "An Unbiased Military"
 CHU_build_neutrality_desc:0 "Ever since the creation of the provisional government the military has always been viewed with suspicion, and since the coup it has only been viewed as a warlord state.

Once the military is viewed as a neutral party we can begin to negotiate properly."
 CHU_fall_military_junta:0 "But A Correct One"
 CHU_fall_military_junta_desc:0 "As much as the Japanese Patriot Party and the military would insist to the contrary the fact of the matter is that the military still controls Chugoku. The continued state of martial law, however, has been declared by the Japanese Patriot Party. And they won’t be leaving power.

 CHU_last_stand_desc:0 "Every soldier must be ready to die for Japan. Every recruit must be prepared for the pain of a gut wound and still be ready to stand and fight. It is not enough to simply fight bravely. It is not enough to fight until one runs out of ammo. Every soldier must be ready to hold their position and die defending it, every soldier must be ready and eager to draw his bayonet and charge the enemy. Surrender must be removed as an option."
 CHU_recruit_volunteer:0 "Japan Needs You!"
 CHU_recruit_volunteer_desc:0 "By studying the recruitment posters of Britain and the United States during the Great War we can get an idea for how to draw in recruits. It can also tie in nicely with the glorification of our leadership. There must be a constant stream of volunteers, ready to fight and die for Japan and their home. With such lions it won’t matter how many millions the enemy throws at us."
 CHU_defance_industry:0 "Every Factory An Arsenal"
 CHU_defance_industry_desc:0 "It’s not enough for most of our industry to be dedicated to the military.

Everything must be in place for our soldiers."
 CHU_solve_supply_problem:0 "The Trucks WILL Run On Time"
 CHU_solve_supply_problem_desc:0 "It doesn’t matter how many men are in an army, it doesn’t matter how brilliant the officers are, or the quality of their equipment. If the men don’t have enough of said equipment then they might as well not have a uniform. There must be no shortages. A soldier must not have to worry about how much or how little ammo he has, or how much food he has. The factories will provide all they need, the roads will be smooth and efficient, and the trucks will run on time."
 CHU_land_doctrin:0 "Adapt And Overcome"
 CHU_land_doctrin_desc:0 "It’s often said that all generals prepare to fight the last war. By attempting to fight as how we should have during the Patey Expedition we let the socialists gain ground.

 CHU_reinforce_northern_border:0 "A Bastion Against The North"

 CHU_reinforce_southern_border:0 "Prepare Our Southern Batteries"
 CHU_reinforce_southern_border_desc:0 "With the Naval Junta in Kyushu and the madmen on Shikoku we must be prepared. All of our coastal batteries must be primed and ready, the beaches lined with barbed wire and chokepoints. For any attacker it must be made the longest day."

 CHU_land_doctrin6:0 "Experimental Tactics For An Experimental Age"
 CHU_land_doctrin6_desc:0 "With the advances in motorization and mechanization several men have suggested we seek to adopt more radical tactics. By creating dedicated and independent mechanized and tank forces we can fight the enemy on our terms and deny them the chance to fortify or organize."
 CHU_land_doctrin_mechanize:0 "Mechanized Weapons For A Mechanical Age"
 CHU_land_doctrin_mechanize_desc:0 "Mechanization is the future. The faster our forces can move the more people we can bring to bear. The shock of so many rumbling machines rolling towards them will unnerve our enemies and make them fall back. A car can outrun any man."
 CHU_land_doctrin5:0 "Stick With The Tried And Tested"
 CHU_land_doctrin5_desc:0 "While it’s not as glamorous as the idea of punching through the enemy lines, the old method of superior firepower allowing infantry to make in roads is what has worked before. It worked for the Great War, and considering all the mountains and hostile terrain in Japan it might be better to stick with infantry supported by artillery."
 CHU_land_doctrin7:0 "Japan’s Mailed Fists"
 CHU_land_doctrin7_desc:0 "Even among the more infantry-centric commanders it is impossible to deny the importance of tanks in any modern conflict. Yet Japan lacks an adequete tank of it’s own with which to produce and fight wars with. To this end a competition shall be held between the motor enthusiasts of Chugoku and the engineers in the army. These men will design the most effective tank for our nation in return for a reward."
 CHU_land_doctrin_infantry:0 "New Guns For The New Age"
 CHU_land_doctrin_infantry_desc:0 "The state of our military’s equipment is unacceptable. There are still men who are using Type 30 rifles in our army. If we are to prevail in this time of chaos then we must have better equipment. Only the finest of equipment will do for our soldiers."
 CHU_traditional_army:0 "Ancient Army, Ancient Nation"
 CHU_traditional_army_desc:0 "With the reforms finished much has changed but much hasn’t. Our men are better equipped and trained, our officers have finer tactics. But our pride remains.  Our discipline is as strong as ever. We are still the Japanese Army and we are still the greatest of warriors."
 CHU_work_on_our_economy:0 "To Feed An Army"
 CHU_work_on_our_economy_desc:0 "An army marches on more than its stomach. An army consumes food, wood, horses, aluminum, iron, steel, oil. It is the hungriest of creatures around. If the Junta is to restore order then Chugoku must be able to feed the Army."
 CHU_to_build_an_industry:0 "Idiot’s Guide To Industry"
 CHU_to_build_an_industry_desc:0 "Japan’s industry was never good to begin with, the shogunate having been convinced that the true secret to success was in agriculture.

 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians:0 "Butter For The Civilians"
 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_desc:0 "As frustrating as it may be for the army the fact of the matter is that we need to give some leeway to the civilians. Many, if not most, already despise the military for the strain on the economy and the mass-requisitioning of food. So the army has to tighten their belts for a time before we can get more equipment."
 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_2:0 "Throw Them A Bone"
 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_2_desc:0 "A lot of civilians are asking where a lot of their money goes and how it benefits them. While the answer is obvious they still aren’t satisfied. So we’ve come up with a solution. We’ll cut back on the manufacturing of some equipment to help in the procuring of better medical supplies for the civilians. Hopefully with the burden of healthcare lightened considerably the wretches will be grateful for once."

 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_1_desc:0 "Despite our supply shortage there is a fear that the workers may try to go on strike or worse, unionize. To prevent any slowdown in production on that kind of scale, or worse the spread of the ideals of the Tohoku Peasant’s Republic, the junta has approved a new work calender which allows for 8 hour work days and a slight cut to taxes."
 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_3:0 "Strategic Investments"
 CHU_appease_to_the_civilians_3_desc:0 "Some of our logisticians have suggested investing in some companies and civilian infrastructure.

 CHU_appease_to_the_military:0 "Guns For The Army"
 CHU_appease_to_the_military_desc:0 "“As much as the civilians may not like it the fact of the matter is that we are at war. They can complain all they like about how they have no rights.

 CHU_appease_to_the_military_1:0 "Industrial Requisition Order"
 CHU_appease_to_the_military_1_desc:0 "The civilian owned factories aren’t producing enough for our military. At this point drastic action is needed.

 CHU_build_Kugun4_desc:0 "More and more airpower has become more and more important. However our aircraft industry is virtually non-existent.

 CHU_army_arge_research:0 "Soldiers In Lab Coats"
 CHU_army_arge_research_desc:0 "Just as how our military is in constant need of men and supplies, so too is it in need of more research. Japan paid the price for its backwardness once already and if we are to avoid a second humiliation we must have dedicated R&D units. Whether it be in the field of engineering, chemistry, or construction our scientists must be masters in all such fields and must be aided in any and all forms."
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure:0 "A Japanese Engineer Corps"
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_desc:0 "With the development and improvement of the automobile over the years roads have become more critical. But our roads are currently insufficient to allow for adequate trucking capabilities.

 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_west:0 "Southern Roads…"
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_west_desc:0 "With the concerns for the security in the south increasing it has become more and more imperative that our roads are able to accommodate the troops in the area, whether that be to get them there or to resupply them. As such several bulldozers and tractors have been secured to aid in clearing land to allow for better roads."
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_islan:0 " Little Citadels"
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_islan_desc:0 "The islands have long been neglected infrastructure wise. With the leering gaze of the gaijin and the treacherous eyes of the Kyushu Naval Junta lingering on the islands under our control we have to prepare them to hold out on their own. Once the coral is cleared out some roads and runways can be built so each of them can defend themselves until reinforcements can be deployed."
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_east:0 "Northern Roads…"
 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_east_desc:0 "To better fortify the north we will need more roads to allow for better transportation of concrete and steel.

 CHU_to_build_infrastructure_central:0 "…All Lead To Chugoku"

 CHU_fishing_vessel_industry:0 "Sally Ports On The Sea"
 CHU_fishing_vessel_industry_desc:0 "While we don’t have many naval experts most of the remaining experts have insisted on building a port on the isles so we can have a base not too far off the sea. In addition to allowing for better transport the isle it would also allow for us to build a bigger navy. Since most of the navy sided with Yamamoto this would be especially valuable."
 CHU_to_build_a_navy:0 "A New And Better Navy"
 CHU_to_build_a_navy_desc:0 "After the treachery of the navy we were left with only a few ships and even fewer loyal naval officers. Due to this we have been forced into trying to build a new navy. The only good news is that we can build this new navy in the image of the army leadership. If we even bother with making it a navy. Why not keep it in the Army?"
 CHU_to_new:0 "Blows To The Nose"
 CHU_to_new_desc:0 "By focusing on battleship design we can create better battleships. Battleships that can smash aside the enemy fleets in the decisive battle and allow our landing ships to disembark their men. Or something like that. The artillery department is really fond of big guns. Besides, size matters."
 CHU_to_build_a_navy_docyard:0 "Army Quality Shipyards"
 CHU_to_build_a_navy_docyard_desc:0 "To better facilitate the construction of our new fleet a new shipyard is needed. We’re doing our best to keep it as secret as possible, as much as a giant building project on the coast can be kept secret. But we’re confident and excited for the army’s new shipyard. Or is it the navy’s?"
 CHU_to_new2:0 "Daggers Beneath"
 CHU_to_new2_desc:0 "No matter how much we may dream of a fleet of battleships under the banner of the army there is no realistic way we can produce battleships of the quantity or quality needed to batter destroy our enemy’s fleets or their shipping. But by taking the lessons of the Germans submarine campaign during the Great War and improving upon it we can starve out our rivals. If the enemy can’t get fuel for their battleships they might as well not have battleships. Who knows? Maybe we can even sink some proper warships."

 CHU_ideological_army_design:0 "An Army For All Of Japan"
 CHU_ideological_army_design_desc:0 "To be a Japanese soldier it is not enough to simply be strong or brave. To be a soldier of the Japanese Army is to despise death and the gaijin. To be a Japanese soldier is to hate with all one’s might all of Japan’s enemies, from within and without. Throughout Japan’s history the Japanese soldier has been the one thing that keeps Japan away from utter chaos."
 CHU_military_factory1:0 "Heroic Capitalism"
 CHU_military_factory1_desc:0 "As loathesome as the capitalist is, they have their uses. By offering favorable deals and rights to some of the zaibatsu we can gain an advantage in resources and free up our own men to actually fight."
 CHU_military_factory2:0 "An Economy Fit For An Army"
 CHU_military_factory2_desc:0 "Among many there seems to be a mistake that the army is meant to protect the economy. The truth of the matter is that the economy, just as how the soldier must serve his country, must serve the army. Our army must have no shortages. If all aspects of the economy are shifted to suit this need then so be it."

 CHU_fascist_volunteers:0 "More Rods For Our Bundle"
 CHU_fascist_volunteers_desc:0 "It’s difficult to not notice the similarities between the ideology of the junta and fascism. Though we’ve yet to call ourselves anything close to that until now.

 CHU_ally_other_facist:0 "Dark Oceans For A Dark Time"
 CHU_ally_other_facist_desc:0 "In these dark times the junta needs as many patriots as possible if Japan is to be saved from the chaos of democracy and the evil of communism.

 CHU_ally_facist_SHI:0 "A Temporary Rod"
 CHU_ally_facist_SHI_desc:0 "As infuriating as it is that our junta keeps getting compared to the madmen in Shikoku there may be a sliver of truth in that line of thinking. While we are not in favor of an emperor, since that may limit the military, the State of Shikoku doesn’t know that completely. By posing as fellow-travellers we can arrange a temporary alliance so we can deal with the rest of the wretches."

In the event that they attempt to launch a pre-emptive assault we must have fortresses to counter them.

 CHU_destroy_facism_desc:0 "The alliance between the junta and Shikoku has run its course. Now is our best opportunity to be rid of the lunatics. Once they’re dealt with Japan can begin the true way towards glory and purpose."
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_communism:0 "Communism With Japanese Characteristics"
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_communism_desc:0 "After some debating it’s been decided that Japan would benefit with elements of communism. However what worked in the Soviet Union cannot work here. And so a unique form of communism must be formed for Japan. One that reflects it’s proud history and warrior culture. To this end the generals, not a politburo or a party, shall lead the way to communism."
 CHU_our_communist_workers:0 "Soldiers As The Model Proletarian"
 CHU_our_communist_workers_desc:0 "The more one learns of soldiers the more it becomes obvious that the soldier is the ultimate form of worker and the military is the perfect engine for communism. All are not all soldiers equal aside from what they have earned? Are soldiers not loyal to one another as brothers? This places them above the peasant and the factory worker, both of whom are prone to turn on each other during strikes. Why should the soldier not be the model for society?"
 CHU_our_communist_brothers:0 "Fellow-Travelers"
 CHU_our_communist_brothers_desc:0 "While few outside of the junta have acknowledged the wisdom of our way to communism they still acknowledge us as communists. Let us send out communiques to these fellow-travelers so that we may coordinate and plan to defeat the reactionaries who threaten our revolution."
 CHU_invite_communist_brothers:0 "Japanese Way To Communism"
 CHU_invite_communist_brothers_desc:0 "In spite of some heated words there has been an agreement. Regardless of how the others disagree with the junta there has been an agreement. Japan must become communist if it is to be free of the chains of the gaijin bourgeois. To that end we must all unite or die!"
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_democratic_socialism:0 "Not Too Democratic But Socialistic Enough"
 CHU_we_are_enough_for_democratic_socialism_desc:0 "As ridiculous as the idea of democratic socialism is it is still socialism. To aid in the pursuit of communism we ought to provide aid to the ‘democratic socialist’ states and hopefully help them get rid of the democratic part."
 CHU_send_weapons:0 "Guns to The Roses"
 CHU_send_weapons_desc:0 "“With some of the crises currently facing the socialist government in Ezo we ought to provide some aid. While they may lack guns we have some to spare. A shipment should arrive soon to help our socialist allies out."
 CHU_send_volunteers:0 "Send The Military Assistance Group To Edo"
 CHU_send_volunteers_desc:0 "To further aid Ezo in the defense of the revolution on the island the junta has decided to send a group of advisors to aid Ezo. They should be able to help train Ezo’s defenders and assist in planning. And naturally if they have to defend themselves they can. It just so happens the limitations are limited."
 CHU_deal_EZO:0 "Hiroshima-Sapporo Axis"
 CHU_deal_EZO_desc:0 "Just as how for centuries Japan revolved on the axis of Tokyo and the North, now shall Japan revolve around the Axis of Chugoku and Ezo. One shall be the sword, the other the pen. With this coalition there can be no stopping the revolution. Upon this agreement Japan shall be brought to communism."
 CHU_industrial_help_EZO:0 "Friends With Industrial Benefits"
 CHU_industrial_help_EZO_desc:0 "Ezo’s economy is currently lagging behind. Recently their leadership sent a message to Hiroshima asking for aid. Naturally we shall help our fellow Japanese. We need a strong northern ally after all."
 CHU_war_industrial_help_EZO:0 "Dummy’s Guide To War Industry, Ezo Edition"
 CHU_war_industrial_help_EZO_desc:0 "For all of the spirit of the people of Ezo their war industry is still lacking. To rectify this a delegation of logisticians and experts are to be sent from Hiroshima to help Ezo build up the facilities necessary to arm their forces."
 CHU_communist_workers_send_EZO:0 "How Many Communists Does It Take To Tighten A Bolt?"
 CHU_communist_workers_send_EZO_desc:0 "Despite the dreams for communism in Ezo the sad fact of the matter is that there just isn’t much industrial experience in Ezo, if any at all. To rectify this issue and ease up the amount of aid needed for Ezo a group of workers from Hiroshima is to go and help Ezo to teach its population how to work wrench and if needed get some work done there as well."
 CHU_destroy_FER:0 "Abort The Substitutionist State"
 CHU_destroy_FER_desc:0 "The idea of communism is the liberation of all classes into the working class. The mere existence of a political party that holds the power is prone to corruption. Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the so-called Worker’s Republics. For the dignity of communism they must be destroyed!"
 CHU_reate_autonomous_governments:0 "A Truly Feudal Age"
 CHU_reate_autonomous_governments_desc:0 "In spite of all it’s claims of unity and brotherhood in arms the internal feuding within the junta has reached a boiling point. Officers are openly fighting each other, and pay has become scarce for some of the men. As a result some of the old clans have found themselves in a position to absorb the men and use them in their private armies. From here on out, if the junta wants to get anything done it will have to be done with the consent of the clans"
 CHU_clan_OIK:0 "Heirs of the Western Shogun"
 CHU_clan_OIK_desc:0 "The Okayama Ikeda have managed to absorb enough men to assert their ‘rights.’ From here on out we will have to deal with them. Hopefully they live up to their illustrious ancestor Ikeda Terumasa and help reunify the nation."
 CHU_clan_TMA:0 "Blue Matsudairas"
 CHU_clan_TMA_desc:0 "The Tsuyama Matsudaira have gathered a host of warriors, many of whom deserters with their old kit, outside their old hold in Tsuyama. This host, while not the largest of them, do have a fortress which will particularly hard to crack. They insist that they shall protect their people. Hopefully they are content with that."
 CHU_clan_IKE:0 "Another Ōkanehira"
 CHU_clan_IKE_desc:0 "The Ikeda of Totori have just seceded as well around their old stomping grounds. Let us see if they can use the sword as well as their ancestor."
 CHU_clan_MAT:0 "Red Matsudairas"
 CHU_clan_MAT_desc:0 "The descendants of the great tea master have occupied Matsue Castle once again. They have promised the peasants there that they shall restore prosperity to the domain just as Harusato did."
 CHU_clan_AMA:0 "Heirs Of The Temple Builder"
 CHU_clan_AMA_desc:0 "The Kamei Clan has taken up arms again. They promise that just as how Kamei Koremasa helped Kōdai-ji so too shall they help rebuild the region. What they left out of that promise, of course, was the fee."
 CHU_clan_ABE:0 "Return Of Perry’s Door Knobs"
 CHU_clan_ABE_desc:0 "Somehow the Abe Clan has convinced a group of soldiers and peasants that they can protect them. They profess how they wish to atone for the role their ancestor Abe Masahiro played in signing the Convention of Kanagawa."
 CHU_clan_ASO:0 "Return Of The Magistrate’s Heirs"
 CHU_clan_ASO_desc:0 "The Amano Clan has returned and has claimed a chunk of land for themselves. They swear that just as how Amano Yasukage helped bring stability to Mikawa so too shall they."
 CHU_clan_UCC:0 "How Many Clans Are there?"
 CHU_clan_UCC_desc:0 "Somehow even the minor clans are getting in on the game. In Bitchu a confederation has formed comprised of smaller clans so as to counteract the power of the other clans. Calling themselves the United Clans of Bitchu this confederacy’s self-delcared mission is to protect the stability of Bishu and all the clans."
 CHU_clan_management_0:0 "Ministry of Clan Relations"
 CHU_clan_management_0_desc:0 "While the clans are de facto independent they insist that their private armies are just to ensure order. As tempting as it is to send in our troops, hang the deserters, and burn down the manors the junta’s resources are too few and the external enemies are too great. So we’re left with trying to negotiate. For this purpose the Ministry of Clan Relations has been established to mediate disputes and coordinate with them."
 CHU_select_ideology:0 "An Ideology To Unite The Clans"
 CHU_select_ideology_desc:0 "While the clans are mighty they still must abide by some regulations. Of course to keep them loyal to the junta an ideology must be adopted by which we can unite the clans."
 CHU_select_comunist:0 "Clans As The New Communes"
 CHU_select_comunist_desc:0 "As absurd as it is somehow communism has been the decided ideology. By creating requirements for clan heirs that appear to make sense to the clans we can ease the clans down the road of communist thinking. Many times through out Japanese history daimyos have adopted children who then became daimyo. We’re reaching but it’s all we can really think of to explain the idea."
 CHU_select_fascist:0 "Revive The Three Arrows"
 CHU_select_fascist_desc:0 "Every child knows the story of Mori Motonoroi’s arrows. A single arrow can be easily broken, but three arrows bound together are strong. It’s hard not to see the link to fascism. By adopting the symbolism of Mori’s three arrows we can hopefully unite the clans."
 CHU_select_democrat:0 "United Clan Republic"
 CHU_select_democrat_desc:0 "As absurd as it sounds we could try to utilize republicanism to try to resolve the disputes. By guaranteeing the rights of each clan and having elections it can create a structure by which the clans feel comfortable working in and ensuring the peasants don’t feel neglected."
 CHU_spread_ideology_to_clans:0 "Distribute The Proper Thinking To The Clans"
 CHU_spread_ideology_to_clans_desc:0 "Moment of truth. We’ll begin sending out delegates to inform the clans of our chosen ideology and hope they accept it. Hope and pray they accept it."
 CHU_intagrate_puppets:0 "A New Sankin Kotai"
 CHU_intagrate_puppets_desc:0 "There’s been some grumbling among the clans. It’s becoming increasingly clear that unless we act quickly the junta will face a full rebellion from the clans. Thankfully we have an idea. Just as how the shogunate demanded the daimyos keep residences in Edo and either have themselves or their families stay there the clans remained loyal. When that system broke down the Boshin War began. We’ll do our best to accommodate our guests."
 CHU_join_the_comunists:0 "Workers of Japan, Unite!"
 CHU_join_the_comunists_desc:0 "With the clans pacified we can finally join the other socialist states of Japan. While we can’t agree to unify under a single nation we can certainly unite in alliance to destroy the reactionary dogs."
 CHU_join_the_fascist:0 "Many Swords, United In A Bundle"
 CHU_join_the_fascist_desc:0 "In this violent age only violence can bring peace, but nor can we stand alone. To this end we shall join states such as Shikoku in a coalition. We shall see Japan united again. As Motonari’s sons were united, so too shall Japan."
 CHU_change_ruling_party:0 "Old Ideas, New Elections"
 CHU_change_ruling_party_desc:0 "It’s time to test how well the ideas have gone. We’ll hold elections to determine clan heirs, representation in the legislature and who shall lead the new presidency."
 CHU_war_preparation:0 "Ready The Sashimono"
 CHU_war_preparation_desc:0 "Now that we are at peace with ourselves we must prepare for the war to come. We must begin stockpiling weapons and ammunition, drawing up plans, training men. Nothing must be left to chance. Raise high the banners"
 CHU_invite_democrats:0 "Freedom, Old Families And New Friends"
 CHU_invite_democrats_desc:0 "With the elections settled we can begin reaching out to other republics in Japan. For this purpose some of the clans extended families can be quite useful. While we cannot unite under a single republic yet, we can unite in our disdain for the fascist and the communist."
 CHU_create_democrat_faction:0 "Japanese Liberty Front"
 CHU_create_democrat_faction_desc:0 "As cheesy as the name is it fits. We’ve already convinced some of the more well connected clans in the other republics to assist us in forming this alliance. With this coalition the darkness of fascism and the lies of socialism can be driven out of Japan once and for all!"
 CHU_liberate_puppets:0 "Private Property, The Most Basic Right Of All"
 CHU_liberate_puppets_desc:0 "“Every day the clans of Chugoku here about the deprivations faced by clans in other states. To this end they have come forth demanding war to liberate the other clans. This could be useful in creating new allies and gaining the support of the clans in general. On the other hand this has been forced upon us."
 CHU_continue_with_junta:0 "Warrior Government For Warrior Clans"
 CHU_continue_with_junta_desc:0 "Since the resurgence of the clans many have suggested adopting an ideology to unite them. However the junta has come to the conclusion that as warriors the clans will have the most respect for a warrior-based government. And so the junta remains."
 CHU_puppets_get_closer:0 "Bring The Whole Families Together"
 CHU_puppets_get_closer_desc:0 "To prevent inter-clan conflict and rebellion against the junta a series of protocols are to be in place. First will be a series of hostage exchanges so no single clan would risk aggression against another lest their kin pay the price. Second will be a series of marriages. While old fashioned it’s worked before and nothing is as terrifying as an angry wife."
 CHU_create_new_faction:0 "Stability Coalition"
 CHU_create_new_faction_desc:0 "This time of chaos benefits no one. No one but the evil. Stability must be restored. Rivals won’t become friends but they will put aside their differences. For now the thing that matters most is Japan. The details of ideology must be put aside until the chaos is over."
 CHU_invite_junta:0 "Olive Branch For The Navy?"
 CHU_invite_junta_desc:0 "While interservice rivalry has always existed few nations can say their branches hate each other more than the Japanese Army and Navy hate each other. Ever since the end of the Boshin War one has been neglected while the other received praise. But right now the rivalry must be put on hold. The military junta has been dispatched an emissary to ask Yamamot and the naval junta for a temporary truce. As long as Japan is in chaos the men whom it is supposed to look to cannot fight. That can come later."
 CHU_join_other_junta:0 "End The Rivalry"
 CHU_join_other_junta_desc:0 "The military is supposed to defend its nation of origin. But how can it do that when its branches are at war? For countless years the army and navy have hated each other. And Japan has paid the price. As long as this petty feud lasts there can be no hope of peace in Japan. This must end. The junta has approved a message to Yamamoto, offering peace and unity for Japan. All branches of the nation shall be equal."
 CHU_war_preparation_3:0 "Begin Joint-Planning"
 CHU_war_preparation_3_desc:0 "With the rivalry between the army and navy put aside the true work can begin. Intel is to be shared freely, plans coordinated, and supplies prepared. This chaos cannot go on much longer. For the good of the nation."
 CHU_war_with_juntas:0 "Old Habits Die Hard"
 CHU_war_with_juntas_desc:0 "We were wrong. There can be no such thing as making amends with the naval junta. Only chaos. This rivalry must end. One way or another."
 CHU_war_with_fascists:0 "Operation Chosokabe"
 CHU_war_with_fascists_desc:0 "The time has come to deal with the Shikoku State. As long as they continue to exist they serve as a beacon for the most deranged of mad men. We must remove them quickly, lest they put their insane ideas into practice."
 CHU_clans_developt:0 "Military-Clan-Industrial Complex"
 CHU_clans_developt_desc:0 "A benefit of the return of the clans is their funds. By coordinating investments in joint funds we can begin utilizing them to build up infrastructure throughout Chugoku."
 CHU_clans_developt_military:0 "Modern Tanegashima"
 CHU_clans_developt_military_desc:0 "By the time of Sekigahara Japan had one of the most advanced militaries in the world, with some of the finest generals and equipment around, such that even the Europeans were less than us. So it shall be again. We shall license out some of our designs to the clans and help them build their gun industry."
 CHU_clans_developt_military_2:0 "New Cavalry For Old Clans"
 CHU_clans_developt_military_2_desc:0 "The origin of the samurai lay with cavalry. Before the Mongols the Samurai were primarily horse archers. And the key to the future of the clans lies in cavalry. However instead of using horses, they shall instead use trucks and tanks."
 CHU_clans_developt_infrustracture:0 "Clan Rail Services"
 CHU_clans_developt_infrustracture_desc:0 "To prevent different rail gauges from being used in different clan territories we ought to coordinate with the clans. There is also a benefit to the clans owning rail lines. Perhaps we could decorate tourist trains with more traditional art. The gaijin seem to find Japanese art bizarre but beautiful. Perhaps we could use this to our advantage."
 CHU_clans_developt_infrustracture_2:0 "Clan-Approved Roads"
 CHU_clans_developt_infrustracture_2_desc:0 "As proven by the usage of Trucks by the allies in the Great War there is an advantage to trucks that cannot be found in rails. While they may demand less cost and maintenance they still require some maintenance. For this purpose a road coordination board is to be set up to assist in planning and maintaining roads in clan owned lands."
 CHU_clans_developt_civilian:0 "Righty Tighty"
 CHU_clans_developt_civilian_desc:0 "For all of the wealth of the clans the sad thing is many are still living in 1870 in terms of technology. To help with this, volunteers are to gathered to help the clans properly set up factories so they don’t immediately fall apart."
 CHU_clans_developt_civilian_2:0 "Lefty Loosey"
 CHU_clans_developt_civilian_2_desc:0 "As easy as it is to simply say ‘build the factories for the clans’ the reality is that unless there is an understanding of engineering among the populace there is always going to be a serious lack of progress made in industry. To that end industrial schools are being planned and simple books are being printed to help the peasants living in clan territories how to perform basic maintenance."
 CHU_clans_technology_sharing_program:0 "Create The Tanaka Program"
 CHU_clans_technology_sharing_program_desc:0 "To better coordinate and share technology with the clans a program has been set up via the University of Hiroshima. Calling itself the Tanaka Program, the brilliant engineer and Karakuri puppet maker, this program will help in sharing technology between the junta and the clans."
 CHU_clans_research_program:0 " Found the Ōshima Initiative"
 CHU_clans_research_program_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts the research and education programs of the clans is still lacking. Again, Hiroshima University has come forth with a new program. Named after the inventor-samurai Ōshima Takatō, the Ōshima Initiative’s objective is to foster learning and engineering in rural areas. While there are certainly urban areas under clan suzereinity most are rural and so the Ōshima Initiative is almost tailor made for this situation."
 CHU_make_a_new_country:0 "New Country For An Ancient Land"
 CHU_make_a_new_country_desc:0 "Samurai. Tanks. Honor. Nuclear science. In this chaotic mixture of all it is hard to find where one is without going mad. But one thing is clear. For Japan to survive it must adapt. It must progress. It must accelerate."
 CHU_change_in_party:0 "New Organization For The New State"
 CHU_change_in_party_desc:0 "The old system will not work. There must be a new way of things. This is near universal for Japanese affairs in general. This is especially true for the junta. We must seek a proper organization, one which espouses the proper values of militarism but allows for wiggle room for innovation to be made."
 CHU_Chugoku_federal_government:0 "Japanese Federalism"
 CHU_Chugoku_federal_government_desc:0 "With the return of the clans and the decentralization of power Chugoku can no longer be called a state but with its organization and unity it cannot be called a confederacy either. From hence forth the Federal State of Chugoku shall endeavor to restore order to Japan and bring the islands to a glorious future."
 CHU_expand_federal_government:0 "The Annexation Of The Islands"
 CHU_expand_federal_government_desc:0 "The time has come. We proclaim the liberation and annexation of the islands. We shall offer a general amnesty to all officials who surrender within a designated time limit. The road to glory has begun."
