These trade cities were Kobe, Chiba, Hirado, Nagasaki and Osaka. However, in the recent years, the cities have saw a significant decline of garrisons.

 SHO_HOUSE_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "£mm_select_SHO After being forced to abdicate due to the actions of the “Patey Expedition, Tokugawa Iesato has returned. With the chaos of 1930, the weakness of the so-called “Republic” in the face of the rabble being armed by the Soviets has resulted in the land being torn apart. Between fascists, imperials, gaijin, soviets, demagogues, and over-proud officers, the people have begun to appreciate the tranquility and stability of the Old Shogunate. And so Hiranuma Kiichirō, the wise man he is, has invited the shogun to return. However, in spite of the best efforts of the so-called “Samurai Cabinet” the situation is not stable. For starters there is the issue of how the government ought to be run. Some, and if rumors are to be believed Iesato himself, are in favor of a “parliamentary democracy.” While others point at the fact that it was the very same rabble who caused the Chiba Riots which invited the United States to subjugate Japan in the first place to be in power. Then there are the clans and their division, with some desiring diplomacy, whilst others demand war. And some are less than loyal. Of course there is also the issue of alliances. Some say the shogunate should redouble their friendship with the French, who had been the ones to help put down the rebels in the Boshin War. But others are less certain, saying that the French may have lost their taste for war, and argue for negotiation with the Junta. It would make sense on paper, soldiers ought to stick together. On paper, it makes sense. But then we are talking about some generals who failed the shogunate before, can they truly be trusted? Nonetheless for those who sit on the Samurai Cabinet it is clear that Japan needs a shogun. Only with strength, tradition, and honor can Japan be renewed, and what better avenue than the system that for three centuries saw peace and prosperity unrivaled in the history of the land? After all, while the British dumped their waste in their streets, was Edo not a place of cleanliness? Such prosperity and harmony shall be once more under a renewed shogunate.

 KYU_QOH_DESC:0 "£mm_select_KYU After decades of disdain under the shogunate, the navy would find itself instead neglected under the “republic.” When the dust of the Great War settled the navy had been proven correct in its eyes, and the hubris of the shogunate and the army had cost all of Japan. With a new government came new complications, as the republic and the western nations that had installed it viewed the Japanese Navy with suspicion, not as much suspicion as the army but there were a few trials suffered by the navy. The additional funding to the navy saw the branch become the most loyal to the government. Then came 1930. As socialist revolutions broke out, secessionist revolts, landlord uprisings, and an attempted coup wracked the nation, the navy would find itself on its own and so the sailors and officers of the navy left. With the republic confined to Tokyo, the rest of the nation in chaos, and staring down the potential of an army junta, the navy under Admiral Yamamoto withdrew as much of their personnel and their families as they could to Kyushu. After months of negotiations with landlords, fighting with rebels, and back and forth with western powers the Japanese Navy established itself on Kysushu and from there the Naval Junta was founded. For six years the fronts have stagnated. And as ever stagnation has bred unrest. There are reports of officers and sailors wanting to defect to the resurgent Imperials, the so-called “Showa-Interregnum.” But can one truly trust the pretender? The years in exile has changed the House of Yamato, making them more in common with the Perfidious Anglo than the noble Japanese. The chaos on the homefront is not the only issue, however. There is also the matter of land warfare. In the event of an enemy invasion, should the enemy breach the defense provided by ships then the only defense offered by the junta would be some garrisons for bases and paramilitary units. Nevermind attempting to restore order to the rest of the islands. While he has little experience with politics and has no real public backing, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto has proven to be a great leader, one respected by friend and foe alike. The master of the waves must also become a master of land if Japan is to be brought to peace again. Only through the ingenuity, strength, and intelligence of the Navy can prosperity be restored.

With the backdrop of numerous rebellions, riots, foreign occupations, and the agenda of Woodrow Wilson, a liberal democracy was established. While for the first five years of its existence it saw stability and relative prosperity, the republic quickly fell into political bickering, stagnation and corruption. As a result samurai clans in the country, yakuza in the cities, and military station heads began to be looked to more and more often rather than the proper government officials. By 1927 the third president of the republic had been assassinated by an unknown actor of unknown affiliations, which led to a mêlée à trois of accusations involving at least both branches of the military, party officials, yakuzas, and unions. Then came the depression. Despite the best efforts of President Takahashi Korekiyo, the nation has been plunged into chaos by vile bolsheviks, regionalists, strongmen, and monarchists rose up. While the Americans have promised to safeguard our republic, the 5,400 troops they have sent can only guarantee control from Chiba to Gunma. Even so the Provisional Government, formed with the aid of our American friends remains optimistic. The Emergency Government of Unity has been assured by General MacArthur that the United States shall stand with the Japanese people. With the upcoming elections the citizens, the reasonable ones anyways, will be able to decide on whom to lead our nation. President Wakatsuki Reijirō’s pro-west policies have been boon to us. However there are rumors that he and General MacArthur have disagreements over the direction of quelling the rebellions. But the population only needs reassuring, and thankfully the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu have been most generous in the noble goal of national reunification. However, regardless, the people shall decide. Not MacArthur. The Military Junta is unlikely to see reason but if they are willing to be reasonable we should hear them out.

After the humiliation of the Shogunate, for 12 years the whole of Japan suffered under the corrupt “Provisional Republic.” While all suffered under the inept kleptocracy, Ezo was one of the first to refuse the tyranny of Tokyo, American puppets, and corporate tools. As the nation fell into chaos in 1930 the island of Hokkaido would be the first island to be truly free since the gaijin Commodore Perry humiliated the shogunate in 1854. Now, Ezo shall take its rightful place. But will it be the Savoy of a new Japan or a truly free state? This is just one question. Next is the issue of convincing the people of what Ezo is. Few are as enlightened, and so question the purpose of the government. A matter slightly hampered by the origin of some of the origins of most of the republic’s leading figures. But there is one thing the government can offer. Freedom. However, some ask why they should tie themselves to such a ship should a stronger state come along that offers the same thing. Such leeches are too common for comfort. Hence why the republic shall be the only true republic. Then there is the ethnic situation. The Ainu have lived in these lands for millennia and question Testsu Katayama’s presidency. Then there are the old Matsudaira, descendents of the once mighty, now debauched and humiliated Tokugawa. They think they can reclaim their birthright, that they have the right to lead. Nevermind the loathsome gaijin “White Russians,” whom think they can reclaim their petty empire. However they are painfully intelligent and know it, threatening not to defend Ezo, their mother, as they suck from its bosom. To the south is the immediate threat, in the form of the “People’s Republic of Tohoku.” Their mad claims of communism and absolute egalitarianism, seductive to the weak and greedy, is a threat to the island which would make a fine jewel for their fetid crown. Then there are the rest of the despots. Strongmen, “republicans,” and children playing in their father’s shadow, these are what are meant to oppose our republic. But what of outside? What would the Koreans think of the civil war? And what of the Chinese, do they think us a jewel for their crown? Nevermind the perfidious communists in Siberia. Either way they must fall. As our government balances tradition and progress the republic shall conquer all who threaten freedom. The Matsudaira and “White Russians” will defend the island or they shall die.

As a result of the collaborationist’s weakness, socialists spread chaos. Instead of allowing the army to restore order the petty republicans issued strikes out of spite for the patriotic junta. As the Americans shelter their collaborationist allies chaos reigns. Only the Junta can restore peace, prosperity and pride to Japan. In spite of the best efforts of the treasonous navy, the vile socialists, the backwards imperials, and the loathsome republicans, the junta endures. Too many soldiers have been lost and too much weakness and vileness has been displayed by all others who call themselves the true government of Japan. Only through the strength and unity of the army will Japan become a prosperous and independent land once again. Not all can see the validity of the junta’s claims though, even among the rank and file. Many defect, saying the junta has no ideology, that there is no belief to fight for, comparing the junta to warlords. This ideological and moral malaise must be treated, and quickly, lest too many throw down their arms in surrender. Some suggest that the junta form an alliance with one of the more “right wing” powers, others suggest seeking a detente with the republic. The army laws must also be looked at, for if they are too cruel to the natives then they will revolt, but the junta cannot alienate it’s soldiers.

 TOH_BHAA_DESC:0 "£mm_select_TOH It would be a lie to say that when the Farmer-Labour Party was founded on December 1st, 1925 by the Japanese Peasant Union that revolution was not on the mind of its founders. Whereas many socialist parties appealed to the city-dwellers the Farmer-Labor Party appealed to the farmers. However soon there was an explosion of several other socialist parties such as the Japanese Farmer’s Party, Labour-Farmer Party, Japan Labour-Farmer Party, Japan Masses Party, Enlightened People’s Communist Party, and finally the Japanese Communist Party. With so many rival socialist parties it led to the awkward situation where revolution was agreed upon but not how or to what end. Despite this chaos in the end the Farmer-Labour Party managed to secure a powerbase in the rural north. Then in the early 1930s the breakthrough happened. With aid from comrades in the Soviet Union in the form of arms and funding. Then the Army stepped in and tried to launch a coup. Though the coup failed it led to a domino effect, as the weak liberal government lost land to a shogunal revolt, an imperial revolt, and a seperatist revolt in Ezo. Under the inspired leadership of Oyama Ikou the Farmer-Labor Party declared a proletarian republic. However in 1931 cracks began to re-emerge. It started with the formation of the Japanese Trotskyist Movement under Kuroda Kan'ichi, enraging the Stalinists and their paymasters in Moscow. Whilst economically Oyama and the Farmer Agrarian Parties seek to continue to support the small farming elements, opposed by Inejirō Asanuma who believes that only by a harsh system can the Japanese people be able to achieve communism. Opposing Inejirō diplomatically is Mosaburō Suzuki, who believes that pacifism and diplomacy is the true way forward. Regardless of who wins the political struggle within the Tohoku People’s Republic, it must break the deadlock if the Japanese are to be freed from the lies of facism, monarchism and liberalism. Making the situation of the People’s Republic even more awkward are the western powers. The decadent bourgeoisie westerners are unlikely to let the proletariat of Japan unite without interfering. As for our comrades in Russia, while they have been generous there are concerning rumors about Comrade Stalin.

Their years under the protection of the British have given them new insight as to the way forward. With the collapse of 1930 once more people cry out for monarchy and Hirohito answered, supported by his British friends. With the provisions and training gifted the Imperial Army has reclaimed Kyoto, restoring it and several other municipalities to the fold. With this foothold the reforms have truly begun. However in spite of Hirohito’s benevolence there are those who are unappreciative and demand more, or more sinisterly, think to usurp his throne. The system is unappreciated by the fanatics and the libertines, while some wage their own war over how to end the war which so plagues the nation. The Ancient Faction desire a return to the dual system of shogun and emperor, as though there could be any lasting harmony between such a breed of brutes. Meanwhile the Democratic Faction seek to spoil the people, unable to learn from the failures of the so-called Republic of Japan. However the surrounding neighbors of Kyoto are all opposed to the restoration and have proven themselves as savage as Oda Nobunaga. For all the zeal of the Imperial Army in comparison to the dogs of the other factions, the emperor’s servants are merely a paramilitary. Still there is some hope. The Imperial Faction believest that by utilizing the prestige of Hirohito they can encourage desertions, bringing information, resources, and supplies with the turncoats as they join the righteousness of the emperor. Furthermore the promises made to the Naval Junta may grant a new ally to boost the position of Kyoto. Whether by military elan or skilled diplomacy the Imperial Assembly and Emperor Hirohito find themselves in a central area, surrounded by enemies. But did the diplomat of Florence not say how beneficial it was to have a central area from which to expand? Did the emperor not read his book on politics?

 SHI_QOH_DESC:0 "£mm_select_SHI In 1919, as the Gaijin celebrated the collapse of the Shogunate there were still those who remained true to the ideals of a greater Japan. However this did not mean they all wanted the shogunate restored. There was a general feeling of confusion, as there were some who found themselves in the painful reality that Japan needed to modernize but if Japan abandoned what it meant to be Japanese then there might as well be no Japan. Then came Mussolini’s March on Rome. The idea of a third way, a way in which a nation could modernize but keep itself appealed to many. The notion of a bureaucratic state also appealed to many in the army who had felt the nation needed to militarize. And then there was the third benefit. A cure for the brewing conflict between the peasant and the landlord, the worker and the factory owner. The idea of national syndicalism. This third issue would appeal more and more to the landlord and the common man who wanted change but also to avoid a “class war.” And so when the chaos of 1930 reared its head and Japan was divided, Adachi Kenzo emerged to champion the new ideologies of facism. Massing a cadre of loyal followers to the hitherto peaceful island of Shikoku. With aid from sympathetic army personnel, politicians, and the shadowy Black Dragon Society, Adachi Kenzo attained power on the island after a masterful speech. However, despite its promise to unify all of Japan for all Japanese divisions soon emerged. There were varying schools of thought within facist doctrine and some question if a Generallisimo should be the one to lead a Japanese Japan. The now Generallisimo Kenzo is painfully aware of this. Before the self-proclaimed “Government of the Japanese Empire” is a minefield of political pitfalls and military perils. As with any revolution those who feel like they shall lose to it will be rabid in their attempts to destroy Adachi Kenzo and his project. The socialists will naturally oppose us, the demented fools they are.

 AMC_HOUSE_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "£mm_select_CHI In the wake of the Patey Expedition and the subsequent peace treaty numerous treaty cities were made. Chiba was the one given to the United States. While for the years following the end of the war the newly made democracy had its issues it seemed to be working fine. Then the assasainations started. Since then the already present garrison had to be increased. Since the start of the civil war the requirement for more soldiers has only increased. But more and more Americans at home are questioning the value of the city when the men and resources going to the city could be spent at home? For this reason several measures must be taken. For the city to continue being in American hands the issue of the worth of the city must be balanced. A profit needs to be made so that way Congress doesn’t feel a financial reason to remove the troops. Then there’s the native resistance. Unlike the Navy-ran base at Okinawa the city is a civilian affair, and so we can’t in good faith have marines going around making sure people aren’t causing trouble. However there is a solution for both. Numerous companies have expressed interest in Japan. If we could give privileges to these companies they could lobby on the city’s behalf in Congress and build the economy. And while groups like the Pinkertons can’t be employed by the government no one said anything about corporations using them. Aside from the threats from within there’s the threats from outside. While we believe no Japanese warlord is powerful enough yet to attack the city should one become powerful enough they could possibly take the city. And as long as there is an offer to return and not harm American citizens then the country could possibly allow the city to be ceded. It may not even require the use of force, only the threat. For this we must make sure there is an incentive to get Congress to increase the garrison. Or, perhaps we could turn to private sources. While there aren’t many natives who would take up arms for us there are a few. General Trujillo is an example of such a man, albeit he’s Domincan not Japanese. And corporate security could “conveniently” agree to a temporary council. Regardless, Joseph Grew is determined to see not only Chiba remain American and prosper, but the entirety of Japan. The nation and people of Japan are a promising and strong people and their energy is wasted fighting over shoguns, emperors, generals, and daimyos.

Before the depression and the civil war in Japan. With each day that passes news filters to the sons of France posted in the colonies, usually men deemed by the republic to be “dangerous to republicanism,” of how France’s military has been gutted, her veterans spat on, and the brithrates plummeting.

Men who may either cause us pain or redeem France. Ever since the Affair of the Cards royalists and Bonapartists were denied promotions and decorations, sent overseas to distant parts of the empire to keep them from launching a coup. Many of these men have found themselves in Kobe. There are three forces who seek to undo the republic. The Bourbonists believe in the restoration of an absolutist monarchy under the House of Bourbon, proselytizing that the House of Bourbon guided France for three hundred years and during that time saw as many crises as the Third Republic. Then there are the Orleanists who believe a constitutional monarchy is the best route for France, arguing for the combination of representation of the people by voting and the steady hand of a monarch. Then there are the Bonapartists, who point to the glory of Napoleon I and the condition of Paris under Napoleon III. Regardless of who takes the reigns of Kobe, if anyone aside from the republican administration does, there is the issue of the outside. Naturally all the Japanese warlords are a concern to the European powers and the Americans but only the French have realized the threat posed by the other treaty powers. We must understand not only what Hirohito’s plan is but what the other treaty nations' schemes are. But whom is the bigger threat? Perfidious Albion, the Germans, the Yanks? Nevermind the debate as to which of the warlords are most dangerous. Regardless, the sons of France are determined to see them all off.

It’s difficult not to notice the Americans struggles with their own economies. Perhaps a deal could be arranged. Okinawa for cash. As for the issue of the warlords, the creation of the “Trade and Stability Group” could provide a provision for mutual defense. Who knows? If enough blood is spilt restoring order we may have to request a fee. And there’s always the issue of garrisoning the liberated areas. Of course our homeland comes first. The Netherlands too has been hurt by the crisis so our belts are going to have to be tightened and profits increased to make sure the colony keeps going. There’s also the issue of internal politics back home, ever the double edged sword for the dutiful bureaucrat.

While Osaka is a lovely city it is not entirely to the satisfaction of the Colonial Office. However, owing to the horrible losses of the war it has become unpopular to say “we must prepare for war.” It is even more abhorrent to openly state the desire for more of Japan. As for why, the answer is obvious. It’s strategic positioning alone is vital, especially to counter the ambitions of America, China and the vile Soviets. Better Japan in the hands of actually competent and civilized men. As for the threats, they are ironically our greatest treasure. If one of the more jingoistic of the warlords takes power and attacks Osaka then the empire will have to respond, proper troops can be brought over and deal with the threat. There is of course the native insurrection but with proper British strategic thinking, vigilance, and a stiff upper lip they should be dealt with quite easily. The more interesting option ought to be the clans. Just as how the empire deals with the princedoms in India and the chiefdoms in Africa we ought to seek their support. Of course this is a fine balancing act. As for the emperor he is a rather interesting paradox. He could be a useful puppet or a threat. Both are due in part to his alleged divinity of blood, on one hand we can control him, on the other hand if he bites it may take our hand. Nevermind the fanatical “generalisimo.” Of course, however, the project is hindered. The Depression still rages, and must be dealt with. Lord Keynes himself has suggested a series of policies which are very appealing to some of the more educated but there are some who believe that a more hands off approach is a good idea. Regardless with the strife in India it would be poor form to let a single colony become too rowdy. We can request some resources from the wider empire though it does make things awkward, and if parliament is too obstinate we may find our hands bound. Regardless, we are certain of victory. The “Land of the Rising Sun” will make a fine sister jewel for the empire alongside India.

Yet each time the people rose up to the challenge, preserving the national polity. Still, the world has changed, and Joseon had to follow the winds. The European empires had started reaching towards the Eastern Ocean, and twice Joseon resisted, first against the French then against the Americans. Although managing to keep the foreigners out, the younger generation of officials realized that only by opening the country could the dynasty survive. When the British came with a fleet, seeking a new partner after having lost Japan with the Shogunate’s victory in the Boshin War, the future Gwangmu Emperor accepted. This would be the start of the Greater Korean Empire. Riding on the back of British investment, the King started a large scale industrialization and militarization, at times pouring half of the national budget into the army. What would have been excessive waste of funds would prove to be fundamental when Joseon joined the coalition against the Boxer Rebellion, gaining a seat at the Eight-Nation Alliance and full diplomatic independence from the Qing. No longer restrained by old tradition, the King crowned himself Emperor and proclaimed the Greater Korean Empire. The phoenix has risen once again. The next three decades was a prosperous time, as Korea enjoyed continued foreign recognition and investment, while capitalizing on trade with Qing and later China. Gando was also obtained, if only as a protectorate for now. It seemed that there was no limit to greatness except the sky… until the Great Depression sent shockwaves throughout the world. Now cut off from the formerly lucrative global trade network, Korea had only itself to rely on.

But not for the reasons we desire it to be. The colony has so far been a drain on resources, resources that could be more useful elsewhere for the state. As such we must act to avoid a foreclosure First and foremost is the economic value of the colony. One could go on and on about the surrounding threats from the various warlords but the main issue is the economy. If we are attacked now, aside from the loss of prestige, there would be no reason for, according to the Prime Minister himself, for Portugal to try to hold the colony and be content with evacuating citizens and resources. This is doubly true if a decent price is offered to Lisbon for Nagasaki. As such the city must be made invaluable to Lisbon. Once this is addressed should the governor be truly worried about the rest of Japan’s affairs. The Catholic Church, more specifically Cardinal Cerejeira, are interested in saving the souls of the Japanese. As one of the cornerstones of Estado Novo it is also our concern. As such we ought to try to convert as many as we can, first in Nagasaki and then Japan. The Church offers many boons to the state, it’s soup kitchens are a boon to all poor and prayers can make all the difference. Cardinal Cerejeira has been particularly enthusiastic to spread the love of the Lord to Japan. Perhaps too enthusiastic. If we lose hold it may be Cerejeira and His Holiness who rule Nagasaki. Regardless, one must keep faith in such trying times. Faith in God, faith in Salazar, faith in Portugal, and faith in oneself. Nagasaki shall be a Catholic city to match Lisbon and the Japanese shall be saved. May Saint Anthony of Padua and the 26 Martyrs of Nagasaki pray for us."
 REI_TRADE_DESC:0 "£mm_select_REI After the Great War Germany was left scarred. Humiliated. Losing all of its overseas territories, and burdened by war indemnities and restrictions on the military that had suffered so much a final blow was landed. Perhaps France and Britain laughed when Kaiser Wilhelm II was murdered by communists. The german people were disgusted and outraged, and so when Kapp and Ludendorff marched on Berlin and dismissed the Reichstag the people were eager to welcome the return of Wilhelm III. Even if Wilhelm III remains a shadow kaiser. Now, as part of an agreement reached with the Shikoku State, we have been given Yawatahama as collateral. German equipment and knowledge for the promise of preferred trading partner status, and a billion reichsmarks. Promises we should prepare to not be fulfilled and for us to take advantage of. Internally there are those who believe that Yawatahma is easy pickings for their own aims, be they German extremists, Japanese nationalists, or one of the lackeys of the French and British. For this reason the Kolonialpolizei has been created. Yawatahama shall provide an excellent testing ground for them, and future agencies at home. As for the Japanese warlords we must be ready. The renewed Heer will protect all Germans, though in Japan we must have a tight belt. Nonetheless we are confident in the old Prussian virtues. Economically we too have been devastated by the economic crash. There are some rumors among the more cynical and pessimistic of generals to sell Yawatahama. However these views are not shared by Ludendofrf. We will make Yawatahama a profitable part of the German Empire, even if we have to squeeze the blood from each savage here. But that is not the only issue. With Germany preparing to reassert itself in Europe we must also be ready for the colony to be able to maintain its strength and loyalty to Berlin. When that day comes we must all be ready to play our part. With the reichswehr and the kaiser in control Germany seeks to reclaim its destiny. And Japan is a part of that destiny. Soon all shall bow before the German flag! GOTT MITT UNS!"
 IMS_QOH_DESC:0 "£mm_select_IMS After the creation of the Republic of Japan the Japanese Navy, long neglected, suddenly saw an influx of funding. While nowhere near the fleets of the great powers, the Japanese Navy was starting to become something formidable, respectable. Then came the civil war. In the wake of socialists and army dogs trying to overhtrow the republic, instead of rushing to defend the republic and the freedoms that they had sworn to protect the high command of the Japanese Navy settled in Kyushu and declared a junta of their own, taking with them most of the fleet and marines. Most. A few said no. A few joined the other warlords. A few joined forces with a Marine Division on the Seto Islands. From this force of marines and sailors the Confederations of the Free Seto Islands was born. Internally there are still some who believe that we ought to join forces with Yamamoto, or swear fealty to the shogun or emperor, while others say we should rejoin forces with the remnants of the republic, and a few who say we ought to join forces with the “fellow workers” in Tohoku. Then there are those who believe we should go our own way. Regardless of what happens next we must be unified! As for our economy it must be addressed, as ambitions alone cannot supply our ships and ammo. Perhaps we could look to western powers for aid, especially the more democratic nations. Though there are some who suggest more dishonorable means of getting funding. As for our military we lack men so we must be careful with them! Good tactics and equipment and discipline, not overwhelming numbers, will win our battles, on land, sea, and air. As for the warlords who have carved up Japan there are two that immediately stand out. The first is the army junta, the wretches who caused this mess in the first place. Doubtless they will see the ships in our possession and see them as a prize to be plundered. The second rival, sadly, are our own fellow sailors in the naval junta. While few can question the courage and skill of the sailors, the high command has tarnished the honor of our former brothers. Sooner or later there will be a reckoning between us and the mutineers. We may be faced by threats on all sides but with cunning, skill, and superior firepower there is nothing that cannot be overcome. And once the warlords and mutineers are dealt with what keeps us from dealing with the treaty cities? What keeps us from our rightful place as guardians of the Pacific? Ryujin, dragon king of the sea, help us drown Bishamoton’s wrath!"
 FER_BHAA_DESC:0 "£mm_select_FER Since the revolution eighteen years ago there has always been the naked fact that the bourgeois and Bonapartist regimes of the west will forever hinder and seek the destruction of the Soviet Union. As such in all fronts the Workers’ and Peasants’ Army must stand ready. And with the chaos in Japan it provides both threat and opportunity. But perhaps the greater threat is inside. After all, to butcher a Roman’s words, a foe at the gates at least flies their banners openly whereas the traitor moves about the gates freely. Thusly we must be on guard General-Secretary Stalin’s reforms are still ongoing and need time. The rapid industrialization may be called reckless by the bourgeois but we call it necessary. Only with these reforms can socialism be defended and the path to communism begin. Needless to say the kulaks shall resist these reforms. However, perhaps more pressing is a rumor. Kirov’s murder still haunts the general-secretary, and the trial’s revelations have many worried. How many more traitors and Trotskyists hide among us, daggers ready? Every soldier, officer, and bureacrat must be absolutely loyal to the revolution. Too many have died for the revolution for it to fail now to the south the “Greater Korean Empire” finds itself torn in three directions. On one side is the old monarchy and their yangban, on another are fellow communists, and then there are the fascists. It is the belief of the NKVD that the success of the fascists would destabilize the region. Though whether it is better for the Korean people to walk to socialism or have socialism brought to them is debated. As for the Republic of China it is the primary concern, it’s massive population of peasants makes it both tempting to spread socialism to but also a threat. As for our Japanese comrades, the general-secretary is concerned about the presence of a Trotskyist faction. Regardless once the Far Eastern Soviet Republic’s industry is built, the farms properly functioning, and the soldiers ready then the true work will begin. Once affairs are settled at home, then can we spread communism to the world. Or perhaps it is better to walk hand in hand with all nations and peoples of the world to communism together? Regardless one thing is clear, the road to true communism shall begin this year of 1936!"
 GAN_CHSN_DESC:0 "£mm_select_GAN In the wake of the reforms and successes of the Greater Korean Empire their eyes began to drift. In Gando there was a decent population of Koreans. However the Chinese Republic, divided as it was, would unify to protect what they felt was their national territory. And so a stalemate began. In the end, with aid from other powers, a settlement was reached. Gando would become a separate territory. This has been a less than ideal solution and has only delayed the inevitable. Internally there is a storm brewing. There are some who are Chinese nationalists who wish to gut us and return to China. There are a few who want to ring our necks and return to Korea. But perhaps the best way for Gando to survive and prosper is to be neither. An Asian Switzerland able to profit from both sides and remain a free and stable nation instead of a colony. As for external threats, aside from the fickle tides of politics in both China and Korea, there is also the threat of the Soviets. All three would kill countless thousands of our people if given the chance so vigilance must be our greatest virtue. However given our size and limitations we must also be adept at diplomacy, playing all against each other. There are also the westerners but they will demand their pound of meat and thousands more. But it might just save us. As Japan burns and the world panics we can feel in our bones that it will be here that something cataclysmic will occur. Whether that devours or empowers Gando is up to you, governor. Choe Yeong, Guan Yu, Jesus Christ, any god, hear our prayers and lead us and our governor to victory!"
 ROC_CHSN_DESC:0 "£mm_select_ROC After a century of humiliation, a horrific period of civil war, and chaos there is peace in China. The world basks in awe of the glory that is the renewed glory of China under a republic. That is what the people are told. Few believe it. Rightfully. There is still much work to do. There are still warlords. There is still exploitation of the Chinese by foreigners. But now, for the first time in nearly a century China is able to respond in kind. Hence the burden of our task. The warlords still bay for power. While they were satiated before they are always wary of any encroachment on their “rights.” Sooner or later these men will have to be dealt with, either by force or negotiation. Though if it were the warlords alone that would be too easy. There are some who question the way of China. Is it to be many races under one banner? How often has that worked before without the interference and envy of such vile foes as Britain? Hence the suggestion that the true answer lies in the majority, the Han. But surely this will only inspire violence in response from the other races. Then there’s our own army. There are cliques who believe they know the true way forward. Then there is the Greater Korean Empire. We see how they eye Manchuria, even now in despite of the creation of the Gando Protectorat. There shall be a reckoning sooner or later and they must be reminded of their place. Then there’s the most vile of threats. The Soviet Union sponsors countless terrorists in China, promising utopia, as though the people of Ukraine have seen utopia under their direct guidance. They are the most immediate threat to China and all Chinese. Thankfullly we have made a fine alliance with the Germans and Italians, The Tripartite Pact. They shall aid us as we aid them. However daunting as these threats seem, however, we must remain resolute. We shall deal with the pretender, the Koreans, and the Soviets. And when they are dealt with we shall humble the foreigners, all, and make the Pacific and Asia what it always destined to be: China’s. Let the old men pray to their ancestors, China will grow larger!"
 AMO_HOUSE_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "£mm_select_AMO After the failure of the Boshin War there were some who saw the smoke rising. They were deemed insane. Heretics. Mad men. Millennialists in mockery of the gaijin religion and their dead man on a stick. Then came the Patey Expedition. More opened their eyes. And again they were called insane and this time they were called conspiracists. Then came the chaos of 1930. The faithful realized the truth, and Japan was divided into four categories. The enlightened, the blissful blind, the stupid, and the oppurtinists. War has been forced upon the enlightened. Taking up the insults leveled upon them, the Holy Order of the Knights of Amateratsu have sworn to restore tradition and peace to the islands. Naturally the heathens fear and despise the idea of devotion and so the order is surrounded by enemies, especially from the filthy gaijin who desire nothing more than to plunder the islands of their resources. However as a result the faithful match their hatred with as much zeal. There can be no diplomacy against evil. Only victory, defeat, and stalemate. Though some pretending may be allowed. It won’t last but it may benefit the Order. At a price. Even in the face of such adversity there is some division against the faithful. Some question how the soldiers and civillians of the traitors ought to be treated, whether they can be redeemed or if they must be guided. Then there is the question of how the Order ought to seek a new emperor, a true head of the faith, or if they even should. Nevermind whether High Marshal Togo Heihachiro should seek an “alliance” with the Imperial State of Kansai or one of the juntas. Some say the order is too cruel. Perhaps. Some say that we are not strict enough with the unfaithful. Afterall, a child who is burned does not touch hot metal. Or at least ones that are intelligent. Either way the Grand Master has a horrid series of decisions to make. To the north there are cowards in Ezo, south there are traitors and pretenders, communists and descendants. To the west there are vultures who seek to make Japan the jewels in their crowns. To the east the gaijin seek to act according to their nature as ticks. And the road a head, will determine whether if Japan rises like the sun in the morning or turns to ash like the foreigner’s Rome. Hachiman,war god, guide our sons to victory!"


 OKI_LORE:0 "With the signing of the Edo Agreement the Tokugawa Shogunate was brought to an end. With it came the rise of a new Provisional Government and, more critically, the ceding of islands and cities to the victorious. Among the ceded territories was Okinawa. Strategically located, the island has become a strategic boon for the United States. However this has come with its own issues. With the Japanese Civil War ongoing and the threat of the Soviet Union the garrison and administration of Okinawa finds itself amid a storm. The most immediate threat to the security of Okinawa among the Jap warlords is the Kyushu Naval Junta. With an actual fleet and rumors of revanchism among its sailors they pose the most immediate threat. However as long as Admiral Yamamoto remains in power we believe it should remain stable. Aside from the Naval Junta there is also risk of the Shikoku State gaining control of a fleet. However, compounding this issue is a concern from Congress. The policy of American Isolationism still stands and an attempt to pre-empt a revanchist power or a proper intervention will draw criticism and sanctions from Congress. If the commander launches an assault without good reason the garrison could be cut off. As for the Japanese there is a fear that interfering could unify the Japanese warlords into a coalition. Of more concern to the garrison, in theory, is the ambitions of the Greater Korean Empire, the Republic of China, and, of course, the Soviet Union. The Greater Korean Empire has, since the reforms of Empress Myeongseong, become a threat. As for the Republic of China their naval build up could prove enough, and the old ego of the Chinese is starting to return. But all eyes are on the Soviets. If the “Far Eastern Soviet Republic” makes a move against the US or US interests the garrison must be ready to respond. Then there is the local independence movement which wants to re-establish the Ryukyu Kingdom Economically there are some concerns, the depression still rages, the islanders complain of the soldiers, but they’ll be made proper Americans given time. If the island has time. There are rumors from some of the pagan priests of the Japanese that their war god, Bishamoton, has awoken. If so, the guns of the US Navy will be ready."
