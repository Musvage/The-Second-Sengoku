Thus, we must begin to construct a huge chain of fortifications along our coasts, and fortify the main city as well to defend our homeland from foreign invaders!"

OSA_foreign_policy:0 "Look Outwards"
OSA_foreign_policy_desc:0 "'A turtle can never see the world if it never leaves its shell.' This famous proverb could be applicable to us too.
