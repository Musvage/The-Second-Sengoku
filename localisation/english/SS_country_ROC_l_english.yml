Scholars reinterprete current affairs through the lens of anciente wisdom.\n\nA group of scholars, a bit more enthusiastic than the rest, appealed to any authorities they could find for help in their newest research... \"research\" being possibly a stretch. They claim to have found the remains of an old sorcerer from the early days of the Qin dynasty: Lo Pan. This powerful entity was cast out of our world by the \"Curse of No Flesh\", which can be lifted - they assure - by a ritual that includes the ghost of the sorcerer marrying a gree-eyed bride, a rare commodity in China. Once freed from the curse, Lo Pan can guide China back to its glory days. Or so they claim.\n\nThe scholars kindly ask for official help to seek this bride."

At first, the congressmen laughed, but when the chairman tried to dismiss him, he was struck by a death-ray cast from Lo Pan's fingernails and vaporized. The rest of the congressmen had a sudden change of heart and proclaimed Lo Pan as Emperor-Sorcerer."
