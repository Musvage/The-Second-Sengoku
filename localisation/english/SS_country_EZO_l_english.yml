However not all [Root.GetAdjective] communists support them, calling them 'Trotskyists' and traitors to the island. However, the Akai participants continue to march the streets and attack anyone they see fit. We can follow either the Communist party's choice of action; which is just to sign a document that allows workers a trade union, for the Akai Rising to cease, while the conservatives recommend just not listening to communists overall, calling it a huge scheme and plot.
