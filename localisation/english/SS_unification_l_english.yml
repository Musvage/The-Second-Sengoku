 ### HELP
 help_unification_tooltip:0 "After Japan crumbled under the weight of its internal struggles, its future became uncertain. Any §HJapanese§! nation is a §Hpotential candidate§! to lead the unification of the fractured country.\n\nWhile many claim to be the true successor of the Japanese State, only the claimant with the most §Hlegitimacy§! can enforce its will over the smaller breakaway countries. Legitimacy can be gained by:\n   - holding §Hforeign ports§!\n   - controlling §HEdo§! or §HKyoto§!\n   - maintaining the §Hlargest army§!\n   - maintaining the §Hlargest navy§!\n   - controlling the largest Japanese §Hpopulation§!\n   - obtaning §Hinternational recognition§!\n   - maintaining the largest §Hnuclear arsenal§!\n   - joining and leading §Hfactions§!\n\nIt is possible to §!claim control over portions§! of the original Japanese territory. This is a §Rdangerous move§!: every nation with its capital on the claimed territory will have to choose between §Gannexation§! and §Rwar§!."
