 shogunate_oldevent.45.t:0 "The Officers' Revolt"
 shogunate_oldevent.45.desc:0 "Our inability to quickly defeat the Knights of Amaterasu has proven to be the last straw for a few of our generals, and there are reports of a major insurrection in the northeast led by General Hatazo Adachi.

 shogunate_oldevent.46.t:0 "We won?"
 shogunate_oldevent.46.desc:0 "Someway, somehow we have defeated the Shogun.

 shogunate_oldevent.49.desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, the Constitutionalist forces were beaten back, and the war is largely over. It seems like our plans to peacefully integrate Kansai will not happen. Not all is lost, however, as our defence of a constitutional monarchy has earned us the respect of Nobuhito, Hirohito's younger son. We must call upon him immediately to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne, and we must also put an end to the wicked reign of Hirohito."

 shogunate_oldevent.55.desc:0 "Following yet another conflict in which both the people and the military have yet again shown their lack of loyalty and respect for the fading Shogunate, [SHO.GetLeader] has decided that reforms are in order. Inspired by the British and Prussian constitutional monarchies, he has called out for Representatives all across the political spectrum to meet at a "First Japanese Congress" to better discuss the direction of the nation."
 shogunate_oldevent.55.a:0 "This is sure to upset someone..."

 shogunate_oldevent.56.t:0 "A Bombing at the Congress!"
 shogunate_oldevent.56.desc:0 "A madman somehow infiltrated the security of the First Japanese Congress and set off a bomb inside the premises. Though most delegates escaped unscathed, the terrorist's primary target was achieved: the Shogun is dead. With Iesato's passing, his next of kin is Tokugawa Iemasa, a much more autocratic figure than his father. His first edict was to suspend the congress indefinitely and strip the delegates of all power they may have had, but in an astonishingly quick recovery from the attack, the Congress has been assembled once more and defied the Shogun's orders. This led to a tense standstill, neither side wanting to yield an inch, which was broken when Iemasa ordered the Congressional Police to arrest all delegates, and in a telegraph heard throughout Japan, the Police Commissioner relayed the following order:"
 shogunate_oldevent.56.a:0 "All officers, protect the Delegates, We will not bow to tyrants"
 shogunate_oldevent.56.b:0 "All officers, neutralize them, lethal force is authorized"

 shogunate_oldevent.57.t:0 "The Democratic-Communist Split"
 shogunate_oldevent.57.desc:0 "Despite the common enemy, the mounting pressures in the nascent government in Chubu were far too great to bear. After weeks of growing tension, it all climaxed into a heated discussion between a noble gentleman member of the CDP and a fellow representing the JCP. After more than a few accusations and profanities, the leaders of the two parties accused each other of either being a soviet puppet or an American lapdog and vowed to break the flimsy coalition that kept the country together. The following fight for power was brutal but in the end..."
 shogunate_oldevent.57.a:0 "The CDP came out on top"
 shogunate_oldevent.57.b:0 "The JCP's communist revolution was successful"

 shogunate_oldevent.58.t:0 "The Americans Request Izu"
 shogunate_oldevent.58.desc:0 "As per our promise, the Americans have found themselves at war, and have thus contacted us to establish bases in Izu for the duration of their conflict. They have assured us that as soon as they are at peace, all military personnel will be withdrawn and the islands will be completely under our control again."
 shogunate_oldevent.58.a:0 "A token of our friendship"

 shogunate_oldevent.59.t:0 "The Americans return Izu"
 shogunate_oldevent.59.desc:0 "Much like they promised, now that their war has been concluded, the Americans have returned control over the Izu islands to us, and we are free to manage them as we see fit once again."
 shogunate_oldevent.59.a:0 "Let's hope they didn't make too much of a mess"

 shogunate_oldevent.60.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Stands Defiant!"
 shogunate_oldevent.60.desc:0 "Despite our diplomatic pressure, it seems like [FROM.GetLeader] believes that [FROM.GetNameDEF] has what it takes to survive alone. We did not wish to kill our fellow Japanese in our search for unification, but we are certainly not above it either."

 shogunate_oldevent.63.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses"
