 shogunate.38.desc:0 "With their victory assured (largely by our hands), the Constitutionalist High Command has petitioned to join our Union in exchange for the adoption of a Constitutional Monarchy, with Emperor Hirohito as the figurehead monarch, just as we intended for them to do"
 shogunate.38.a:0 "Everything goes according to plan..."

 shogunate.39.t:0 "The Center, United"
 shogunate.39.desc:0 "With the regions of Chubu, Kanto and Kansai under our control, we may finally unify Central Japan into one political entity, and rename our country to something more fitting."
 shogunate.39.a:0 "Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!"

 shogunate.40.t:0 "The Matter of the Capital"
 shogunate.40.desc:0 "Though the city at the heart of Japan has been renamed Tokyo, it would not be impossible to push for the reversal of the name back to Edo, and some within our cabinet might even like the traditional name for the capital city. The decision, however, ultimately falls to the Prime Minister and the Emperor himself, which after discussions have agreed to..."
 shogunate.40.a:0 "Keep the name of Tokyo, a modern name for a modern nation"
 shogunate.40.b:0 "Rename it, Edo, tradition is of the utmost importance"

 shogunate.41.t:0 "The West is Ours"
 shogunate.41.desc:0 "Our glorious armies have now brought the western part of Japan completely under our control, and now we may finally hold a grand ceremony to celebrate this momentous occasion, and proclaim the birth of the Western Japanese Empire"
 shogunate.41.a:0 "Japan must be united!"

 shogunate.42.t:0 "The East is Ours"
 shogunate.42.desc:0 "Our glorious armies have now brought the eastern part of Japan completely under our control, and now we may finally hold a grand ceremony to celebrate this momentous occasion, and proclaim the birth of the Eastern Japanese Empire"
 shogunate.42.a:0 "Japan must be united!"

 shogunate.43.t:0 "The Knights Have Made Their Move"
 shogunate.43.desc:0 "The dastardly knights have taken the province of Noto, and reports are coming in of "Fortresses" made by them deep into our territory. We must crush them swiftly, as there are rumours of insurgency in our military, and only a quick victory will earn their allegiance back. Call up the reserves and mobilise the Police to fight."
 shogunate.43.a:0 "We cannot blunder this."

 shogunate.44.t:0 "A Fortress Draw"
 shogunate.44.desc:0 "Our soldiers have proven their valour, and the Knights have been pushed back. They have annoyingly retreated to Notojima Castle, away from our grip for the time being. An armistice of status quo ante bellum has been signed, and the last Knights are making their retreat at this very moment"
 shogunate.44.a:0 "A small victory, but a victory nonetheless"

 shogunate.45.t:0 "The Officers' Revolt"
 shogunate.45.desc:0 "Our inability to quickly defeat the Knights of Amaterasu has proven to be the last straw for a few of our generals, and there are reports of a major insurrection in the northeast led by General Hatazo Adachi. Our armies are badly bruised, and we cannot hope to sustain a two-front war. The Shogun has already agreed to an Uti Possidetis armistice with the Knights."
 shogunate.45.a:0 "Humiliating, but we have bigger concerns at the moment."

 shogunate.46.t:0 "We won?"
 shogunate.46.desc:0 "Someway, somehow we have defeated the Shogun. Our victory, however, seems shortlived, as the Provisional Government, the Imperial State of Kansai, the Tohoku People's Republic and the Order of Amaterasu have already started carving out our lands, and our military has all but deserted us after the civil war. It appears that there is nothing for us to do but die."
 shogunate.46.a:0 "Wait, what?"

 shogunate.47.t:0 "The Second Invasion"
 shogunate.47.desc:0 "After taking most of our borders, our enemies once more invade our lands. We must gather what we can and retreat to our capital, to try a last stand at the gates of Nagoya"
 shogunate.47.a:0 "The situation worsens"

 shogunate.48.t:0 "The Last Stand"
 shogunate.48.desc:0 "Our last line of defence has been broken, the enemies are at the gates of Nagoya. The Commander of the Gate has already defected, and all hope of putting up a defence is lost. After permitting all remaining generals to either leave or to commit seppuku, Hatazo Adachi himself brought out his tantō to end this, here and now."
 shogunate.48.a:0 "With one swift stroke to the abdomen, it is all over."

 shogunate.49.t:0 "The Absolutists Win"
 shogunate.49.desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, the Constitutionalist forces were beaten back, and the war is largely over. It seems like our plans to peacefully integrate Kansai will not happen. Not all is lost, however, as our defence of a constitutional monarchy has earned us the respect of Nobuhito, Hirohito's younger son. We must call upon him immediately to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne, and we must also put an end to the wicked reign of Hirohito."
 shogunate.49.a:0 "We will do this the hard way"

 shogunate.50.t:0 "The [SHO.GetNameDEF] asks for a Pact"
 shogunate.50.desc:0 "The rising power of [SHO.GetNameDEF] is undeniable, and with their first elections, the Liberal Party has been put in power, and [SHO.GetLeader] has asked us for a mutual military assistance treaty, along with our induction into their research initiative. This could be a good way to consolidate our power over Central Japan, two republics standing against fascists, communists and monarchists alike."
 shogunate.50.a:0 "May our bonds of friendship forever be unbroken."
 shogunate.50.b:0 "We need not their empty promises."

 shogunate.51.t:0 "[PRO.GetLeader] Denies our Treaty"
 shogunate.51.desc:0 "It seems like our words fell on deaf ears at [PRO.GetNameDEF], for they have refused to answer our requests for a mutual assistance treaty. Though not entirely unexpected, this certainly is a disappointment, since they will be more unlikely to accept when the time for us to become the leading power in Japan comes."
 shogunate.51.a:0 "He who stands alone, Falls alone."

 shogunate.52.t:0 "[PRO.GetLeader] Accepts our Treaty"
 shogunate.52.desc:0 "Great news has reached our capital. Our request for a mutual assistance treaty has been gladly accepted in Edo, and we can now announce to the world that [SHO.GetNameDEF] and [PRO.GetNameDEF] are proud allies, in defence of Democracy!"
 shogunate.52.a:0 "Great to Hear!"

 shogunate.53.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDEF] Requests our Integration"
 shogunate.53.desc:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] has approached our government with the proposition to integrate us as a governorship into the [FROM.GetFactionName], which would grant us the protection of [FROM.GetNameDEF] from any enemies, but also limit our autonomy inside of the Federation, effectively ending our independence."
 shogunate.53.a:0 "Their heart is pure, we accept"
 shogunate.53.b:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] bows down to none"

 shogunate.54.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Accepts our Proposition"
 shogunate.54.desc:0 "The [FROM.GetNameWithFlag] has accepted our proposition for their integration into the Confederation of Japan, and effective today they are one of our Governorships, owing us taxes, conscripted men and control over their foreign policy."
 shogunate.54.a:0 "This strengthens us greatly."

 shogunate.55.t:0 "Shogun Tokugawa Iesato wants reforms!"
 shogunate.55.desc:0 "Following yet another conflict in which both the people and the military have yet again shown their lack of loyalty and respect for the fading Shogunate, [SHO.GetLeader] has decided that reforms are in order. Inspired by the British and Prussian constitutional monarchies, he has called out for Representatives all across the political spectrum to meet at a "First Japanese Congress" to better discuss the direction of the nation."
 shogunate.55.a:0 "This is sure to upset someone..."

 shogunate.56.t:0 "A Bombing at the Congress!"
 shogunate.56.desc:0 "A madman somehow infiltrated the security of the First Japanese Congress and set off a bomb inside the premises. Though most delegates escaped unscathed, the terrorist's primary target was achieved: the Shogun is dead. With Iesato's passing, his next of kin is Tokugawa Iemasa, a much more autocratic figure than his father. His first edict was to suspend the congress indefinitely and strip the delegates of all power they may have had, but in an astonishingly quick recovery from the attack, the Congress has been assembled once more and defied the Shogun's orders. This led to a tense standstill, neither side wanting to yield an inch, which was broken when Iemasa ordered the Congressional Police to arrest all delegates, and in a telegraph heard throughout Japan, the Police Commissioner relayed the following order:"
 shogunate.56.a:0 "All officers, protect the Delegates, We will not bow to tyrants"
 shogunate.56.b:0 "All officers, neutralize them, lethal force is authorized"

 shogunate.57.t:0 "The Democratic-Communist Split"
 shogunate.57.desc:0 "Despite the common enemy, the mounting pressures in the nascent government in Chubu were far too great to bear. After weeks of growing tension, it all climaxed into a heated discussion between a noble gentleman member of the CDP and a fellow representing the JCP. After more than a few accusations and profanities, the leaders of the two parties accused each other of either being a soviet puppet or an American lapdog and vowed to break the flimsy coalition that kept the country together. The following fight for power was brutal but in the end..."
 shogunate.57.a:0 "The CDP came out on top"
 shogunate.57.b:0 "The JCP's communist revolution was successful"

 shogunate.58.t:0 "The Americans Request Izu"
 shogunate.58.desc:0 "As per our promise, the Americans have found themselves at war, and have thus contacted us to establish bases in Izu for the duration of their conflict. They have assured us that as soon as they are at peace, all military personnel will be withdrawn and the islands will be completely under our control again."
 shogunate.58.a:0 "A token of our friendship"

 shogunate.59.t:0 "The Americans return Izu"
 shogunate.59.desc:0 "Much like they promised, now that their war has been concluded, the Americans have returned control over the Izu islands to us, and we are free to manage them as we see fit once again."
 shogunate.59.a:0 "Let's hope they didn't make too much of a mess"

 shogunate.60.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] Stands Defiant!"
 shogunate.60.desc:0 "Despite our diplomatic pressure, it seems like [FROM.GetLeader] believes that [FROM.GetNameDEF] has what it takes to survive alone. We did not wish to kill our fellow Japanese in our search for unification, but we are certainly not above it either."
 shogunate.60.a:0 "We will prove the folly of their ways"

 shogunate.61.t:0 "Taxation Convention"
 shogunate.61.desc:0 "The [SHO.GetName] has started a convention regarding Taxation in the Confederation. As one of the Governorships that make up said Confederation, we can position ourselves for or against this new initiative."
 shogunate.61.a:0 "We are in Favor"
 shogunate.61.b:0 "We are Against"

 shogunate.62.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Accepts"
 shogunate.62.desc:0 "During the caucus, Governor [FROM.GetLeader] was enthusiastically in favour of our newly proposed reforms, we will have no problem implementing this reform in his territory."
 shogunate.62.a:0 "Good to hear"

 shogunate.63.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses"
 shogunate.63.desc:0 "All throughout the meetings and discussions, Governor [FROM.GetLeader] voiced his concerns. When the motion was put to a vote, he loudly exclaimed how the mere suggestion of this reform was "a gross misuse of power". We cannot expect him to back this reform at all."
 shogunate.63.a:0 "That's a shame."

 shogunate.64.t:0 "Religious Tolerance Convention"
 shogunate.64.desc:0 "The [SHO.GetName] has started a convention regarding Religious Tolerance in the Confederation. As one of the Governorships that make up said Confederation, we can position ourselves for or against this new initiative."

 shogunate.68.a:0 "We are in Favor"
 shogunate.68.b:0 "We are Against"

 shogunate.72.t:0 "The Tokugawa Shogunate"
 shogunate.72.desc:0 "With the death of Iesato, the Shogunate is left with no clear path ahead. Iemasa's explosive personality could spell ruin to the nation, or perhaps its resurgence. In any case, ahead of the new Shogun lie 4 paths. To once more beat the drums of war; To keep the fragile established balance of power; To open up to the West; Or to further isolate the Shogunate. One misstep could mean doom for Japan, and the lives of millions hang in the balance."
 shogunate.72.a:0 "Shōgun heika Banzai!"
 
 shogunate.73.t:0 "The Shogun is after our lands!"
 shogunate.73.desc:0 "Our intelligence has reported that the [SHO.getName] has plans to attack us at some time during the next 2 months!"
 shogunate.73.a:0 "Man our defences!"
 
 shogunate.74.t:0 "Victory at last"
 shogunate.74.desc:0 "After all these years of infighting, finally the Shogun once again rests as the leader of all Japan. To mark this occasion some proposals have been put forth to modernize our country's symbols to finally show the West that Japan is ready to be a major player on the world stage."
