  ### TRAITS
 stalinist_puppet:0 "Stalinist Puppet"
  ### LEADER
 Sanzo_Nosaka_DESC:0 "Sanzo Nosaka, for better or for worse, is here to stay after lengthy power struggles inside Tohoku. Born as the son of a wealthy merchant, he became interested in Communist thought after the October Revolution, and the Great War only solidified his beliefs as an ardent Bolshevik. Seeing the crumbling state of the Shogunate, he founded the Japanese Communist Party, and has consolidated the North.\nThe future is all but well. Even after the power struggles, there are many enemies around him, as the Soviets ever encroach on the autonomy of the Republic and Trotskyphiles become more volatile every day. The battle has been dealt with, but the war is bleak."
  ### IDEAS
 TOH_peoples_militia:0 "The People's Militia"
 TOH_peoples_militia_desc:0 "The situation of the army is peculiar, to say the least. Back when the collapse happened, a large, albeit inexperienced militia was haphazardly formed to protect the borders of the new Republic. While we are good in numbers, the experience of our generals and troops is highly questionable, and reforms will need to be passed to improve the condition of our force."
 TOH_communist_infighting:0 "Communist Infighting"
 TOH_communist_infighting_desc:0 "Power struggles, assassinations, and arguments turning for the worse are a normal day for Tohoku politics. As Sanzo with his Stalinists and Oyama and his Trotskyites have been fighting for years, this is starting to affect the condition of our government and the support from our people. An effective leader must be chosen by the people, and fast."
