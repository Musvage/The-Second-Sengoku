 #####Bookmarks History####
 TS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Shogunate of Japan is a Military Shogunate centered around Central Japan. The faction focuses itself around the Shogun Tokugawa Iesato as their Head of Government and State. With absolute control over their movement, the Shogun in 1936 finds himself at a crossroads between trying to gain the upper hand through regaining the support of their old ally: France. Or instead gaining the favour of the Military Junta to unite towards their common, militarist ambition."
 #####Country Leaders Description####

Yet for his lack of charisma and compelling leadership, he makes up for in his legitimacy as the most rightful claimant to the title of Shogun."
