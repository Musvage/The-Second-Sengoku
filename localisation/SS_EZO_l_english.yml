 # EVENTS
 EZO.1.t:0 "The Akai Rising"
 EZO.1.d:0 "The [Root.GetName] recieved a lot of backclash from the constitution and the rising hatred of a united communist Japan. These heimins/working class believe that they should unite with the Tohoku brothers in the south. However not all [Root.GetAdjective] communists support them, calling them 'Trotskyists' and traitors to the island. However the Akai participants continue to march the streets and attack anyone they see fit. We can follow either the Communist party's choice of action; which is just to sign a document that allows workers a trade union, in order for the Akai Rising to cease, while the conservatives recommend just not listening to communists overall, calling it a huge scheme and plot. They advise to send in the dogs after them."
 EZO.1.a:0 "Trade Unions!"
 EZO.1.b:0 "Dogs..."
 EZO.2.t:0 "The Akai Dream"
 EZO.2.d:0 "Due to the negociations of having trade unions set up with workers rights being now offered nationally, the non-akai communists decided to no longer associate themselves with the Akai Rising and soon the whole rising lost support from a huge majority of communists, that led to the whole event falling apart."
 EZO.2.a:0 "Who likes Tohoku anyways?"
 EZO.4.t:0 "The Akai Death"
 EZO.4.d:0 "One thing led to another, and soon enough there was a clash of ample militia against a punny Akai heimins. It resulted in around 7 deaths, none from the state's side. The government is congratulated by the conservatives for taking strong action, while the Communist Party say that the Akai were martyrs"
 EZO.4.a:0 "Woof Woof"
 EZO.3.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Constitution"

Article 2 states that the main objective of [Root.GetName] is to remain independent and a true [Root.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] state, against the tyrany of communism, fascism, corruption and militarism. Article 3 states that [Root.GetName] should follow the example of the Swiss, where neutrality results in better wealth for the nation and her citizens. Article 4 states that [Root.GetLeader] will be and is the leader of [Root.GetName] until an appropiate time is found to lay the stepping stones to pure democratic socialism. Articles 5-8 state the boundaries of what [Root.GetName] holds, this includes the islands, it's mountains, it's rivers, it's cities and it's seas. Article 9 states that [Root.GetName] will not hold and uplift any financial and diplomatic dept of [PRO.GetName], nor it's rival states. Articles 10-13 state how the country shall be govern. Rejects any ideas of a feudal society of wheere an emperor or shogun shall rule over their heimin. Only the [Root.GetAdjective] peoples' vote matter. Based on popular vote. Finally articles 14-16 state that amendments can only pass by the leader of the state, if the ammendment is unpopular and/or dangerous to the state's independence, it can be vetoed by the upper house.

 EZO.7.t:0 "Operation Takadaya Kahei"
 EZO.7.d:0 "Operation Takadaya Kahei, named after a merchant who was famous from the Kuril Islands, has been established. 1. Rally the Ainu people at the Far Eastern Republic's territory of the Kuril Islands. 2. When they hold for more than 90 days, we shall enter it peacefully as it will be already agreed apon by out diplomats. The diplomats convinced them of 'protection' against the soviets. Whatever works I presume... "
 EZO.7.a:0 "Set up the fire!"
 EZO.8.t:0 "Ainu Peoples' Rise Up!"
 EZO.8.d:0 "The Ainu people rose up in our islands! Stalin looks down apon us for not making sure it would be secure... We need to take it back in 90 days or else it will be lost for good..."

 EZO.10.d:0 "Negotiations have been set between us and the Soviets and we have put up our offer for the Kuril Islands as long as we don't ignite tensions between us and Tohoku. This will also mean we have to recognise them as the rightful Japanese claimant."
 EZO.10.a:0 "Send them the offer!"

 EZO.11.a:0 ""
 EZO.11.b:0 ""
 EZO.12.t:0 "Asahikawa-Tokyo Alliance Proposal"
 EZO.12.d:0 "Time has come for us to ask ourselves if we should align ourselves with the democratic state of Japan. Benefits like recognition of our state would come in handy, however we risk ourselves of bringing ourselves into the main Japanese civil war."
 EZO.12.a:0 "Send it immediately!"
 EZO.12.b:0 "No, we should stay away from chaos."
 EZO.13.t:0 "Asahikawa-Tokyo Alliance Proposal"
 EZO.13.d:0 "A convoy of the Ezo flag is seen nearby. Coastal naval guns are drawn, alert signals are handed down. However it seems to only have a handful of men aboard. One of which is a diplomat, requesting that the Ezo government is interested in joining forces with us. The Ezo state is seen as a traitor state by some as, instead of helping us against the chaos, they ran away into their island to never be heard of again, until now. Should we give them the chance to redeem themselves?"
 EZO.13.a:0 "An Ezo alliance is worth more than pride."
 EZO.13b:0 "Justice will soon come apon Ezo and it's people."
 EZO.14.t:0 "Asahikawa-Tokyo Alliance Proposal"
