EZO.1.t:0 "The Akai Rising"
EZO.1.d:0 "The [Root.GetName] recieved a lot of backclash from the constitution and the rising hatred of a united communist Japan. These heimins/working class believe that they should unite with the Tohoku brothers in the south. However not all [Root.GetAdjective] communists support them, calling them 'Trotskyists' and traitors to the island. However the Akai participants continue to march the streets and attack anyone they see fit. We can follow either the Communist party's choice of action; which is just to sign a document that allows workers a trade union, in order for the Akai Rising to cease, while the conservatives recommend just not listening to communists overall, calling it a huge scheme and plot. They advise to send in the dogs after them."

Article 3 states that [Root.GetName] should follow the example of the Swiss, where neutrality results in better wealth for the nation and her citizens.
