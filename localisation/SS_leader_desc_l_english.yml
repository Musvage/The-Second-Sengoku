 # American Chiba
  POLITICS_GREW_DESC:0 "An experienced diplomat, having served as ambassador for America in a variety of countries, Grew effectively acts as governor to America’s Naval Base and territory at Chiba. Acting as the voice of the United States advising and pressuring policy changes within the Japanese Republic, whom the Americans have historically propped up, Joseph Grew is both loyal to his country and concerned with Japan’s current path. Worried that current American meddling over Japanese democracy is strengthening the cause of those who seek to destroy America’s creation outright, Joseph is more open than most other Western governors in Japan to the prospect of weakening their clutch over Japan."
  POLITICS_SORIANO_DESC:0 "Successful industrialist, especially in the alcohol market, Andrés Soriano is the Philanthropist of the Pacific. Ever caring for the wellbeing of his employees, Soriano takes the same care into account when charged with the protection of both the commercial and civil interests of American influences in Japan."
  POLITICS_KAWANANAKOA_DESC:0 "The claimant to the throne of Hawaii; Kawānanakoa has been established as the chief liaison in the Chiba concession for Japanese Imperial and American interests. Effectively operating as petty king for the American economically-dominated city."
  POLITICS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "Born in 1880, Douglas MacArthur is the son of Arthur MacArthur and a distant relative to Matthew Perry, The man who ended Japan’s era of total isolation. MacArthur’s history had a history with Japan prior to his current posting in Chiba. Particularly inspecting the status of American naval stations across Shogunate Japan prior to the First World War. With additional experience in operations across the Pacific area and in the political field, while simultaneously not being a high-standing commissioned officer, MacArthur has been an easy choice for military guidance over America’s peripheral operations in Japan."
  POLITICS_FUJIMOTO_DESC:0 "The ringleader of the Communist movement in Hawaii, Charles Fujimoto has struck a deal for American Chiba to continue as an autonomous authority over the region while maintaining ideological cohesion with Leftist Japan. Charles now finds himself struggling between appeasing the western commercial population in Chiba and the native communists during this time of transition in the constant balancing act of communist change."
  POLITICS_HALL_DESC:0 "A prominent leftist within the American Pacific, Hall participated in the West Coast waterfront strike in 1934 and has since operated as a news columnist in Hawaii. Following the expansion of leftist influence over Chiba, Hall has been called to operate as the liaison between American trade interests and the Japanese people in Chiba. His placement and continued autonomy in Chiba aims to ensure that there is no sudden economic crisis of capital flight as leftist policies are integrated into this trade-oriented settlement."

 # Chugoku Military Junta
  POLITICS_HATA_DESC:0 "The successor to Kazushige Ugaki, Hata now commands as a warlord of warlords. The very existence of his state is borne out of the armies confidence in their right to govern Japan as a principled and uncorrupted force. Yet the years of stagnation by the military machine in the South has rapidly degraded the internal strength of the Republic’s old army. Hata is a warlord trying to bring order to a government of other warlords An impossible task. Whether Hata’s conviction will see him through or his leadership shall fall to the ambitions of those he commands remains to be seen."
  POLITICS_MUTO_DESC:0 "A native of Kyushu, Akira Mutō became infamous among the military ranks of Chugoku for his increasingly hardline views on dealing with the opposition to the Military Junta’s efforts to restore order and clarity to Japanese governance. It was this trait as a stickler for order than made him an ideal candidate for the fascist, ultranationalist government that has settled itself within the military government."
  baronmuto:0 "Born to an ex-samurai family within the Saga Domain, Mutō’s family lost its place following the Shogunate victory during the Boshin war. His lineage has since never buried the hatchet it festered for their poor choice of allegiance during the war. Despite being a staunch military man, Nobuyoshi Mutō has consequently made an ideal candidate to form a Pro-Royalist authority within the original military staff of Japan."
  POLITICS_HAMAI_DESC:0 "A relatively low-level civil servant within the civil administration for Hiroshima city under its military authority. Hamai become popular for his peripheral role in Pro-Democracy circles within Chugoku while it was under martial rule. With Chugoku now under its new democratic authority, Shinzo has been placed in charge of the local autonomous government to represent the interests of his people."
  POLITICS_YAMAKAWA_DESC:0 "A committed socialist, Hitoshi has come to power in his native region due to his past role in organising the Communist uprisings that occurred in Chugoku during the collapse of Japan. Still a popular among the socialists who have silently awaited his return, Hitoshi has now been charged with building up Marxist governance within the local communities and handling the reactionary influences embedded within the area."
  POLITICS_FUJITA_DESC:0 "The prominent civil servant for Hiroshima until gaining his present post, Wakami Fujita was notably apolitical during the military governance of Chugoku. Neither protesting their rule nor condoning it. His acceptance to contribute his experiences and abilities towards the Democratic Socialist elements who have taken prominence within Chugoku politics is therefore of little surprise."

 # Republic of Ezo
  POLITICS_KATAYAMA_DESC:0 "The Social-Democratic Leader of the Ezo Republic, Tetsu has come to rule Ezo as a comfortable bridge between the winds of socialist change that swept through the Japanese Republic in 1930 and continued respect for the old democratic system prior to the July Crisis. While not at regular odds with the politics of the Tokyo government, President Katayama has continued to serve as one of the few regime leaders in Japan prepared to reconcile and cooperate with the Republic."
  POLITICS_ARAKI_DESC:0 "A descendant of the Samurai and born in Tokyo, Araki has become one of the many ethnic Japanese occupants of Ezo. Having traveled there as part of an arrangement for him to take the reins of protecting the nation under the Provisional Government’s reunification, Araki has taken full control as a result of the loose coalition of Rightist and the Ainu tribe-folk taking power."
  POLITICS_KIDO_DESC:0 "Born in Tokyo, one might be surprised to see Koichi in power within Hokkaido. But the Ezo Republic’s predominant electorate are the ethnic Japanese of the island; who do not particularly care if their representative is a local. Having previously worked in the civil service for agriculture, Kido is extremely familiar with the agricultural aspects of Hokkaido and as such has been placed in charge to protect the island’s economy."
  POLITICS_KITOKURO_DESC:0 "A native to modern day Kakegawa, Baron Kitokuro was neither born during the days before the Emperor’s exile nor held any particular fanatical monarchist values during the days of the Shogun running solo. However, his recent defection from the civil service to the political opportunities in the Kyoto government has seen him reach a position of interim governor for Ezo until it can be restored to the fold of the Empire of the Rising Sun."
  POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "A fervent anti-communist within the Siberian White Russians armies, Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov became the ringleader for the organisation of the exiled white russian troops and officers that fled to the safety of Northern Japan following their defeats in the Russian Far East. His militarist determination has since seen him rise to power; committed to rallying the Russian Right for one last majorly organised effort to contest Soviet power in Mother Russia."
  POLITICS_ISOO_DESC:0 "The renowned Christian Leftist, Abe Isoo, has been placed upon the gubernatorial chair of the Republic of Ezo. Known for his staunch commitment to peaceful change. Abe is determined to reach out to reactionaries and liberals with an olive branch and to teach that Socialist belief through dialogue and peaceful debate to win over the hearts and minds of the people."

 # Durch Hirado
  POLITICS_GRAEFF_DESC:0 "Descending from one of the Netherland’s most influential merchant families from the old Golden Days, De Graeff was once the Governor for the Dutch East Indies. Now assigned to the management of the Dutch governorate in Hirado, which the Netherlands seized less than five years before the total collapse of the Republic. A staunch supporter of benevolent colonialism, De Graeff’s main priorities are to win the hearts and minds of Dutch Hirado and to promote a mediated reunification of Japan."

  POLITICS_CORNELIUS_DESC:0 "Affiliated with the Conservative Christian Historical Union (CHU) from 1917, on 15 June 1917 de Jonge was appointed by Royal Decree to the cabinet of Prime Minister Pieter Cort van der Linden as Minister for War. Responsible for maintaining Dutch neutrality in the First World War, de Jonge was further appointed interim Minister of the Navy on 28 June 1918. He remained Minister in both portfolios until the government fell at the 1918 general election on 9 September 1918. He was later appointed by the government of Hendrikus Colijn to serve on the board of Bataafse Petroleum Maatschappij, and refused appointments as Minister for War and Navy in 1920 and 1922. De Jonge also refused appointment as Queen's Commissioner in Utrecht in 1924."
  POLITICS_KUSUMA_DESC:0 "was an Indonesian politician. Born in Ciamis, West Java, Iwa graduated from legal school in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and Netherlands before spending time at a school in the Soviet Union. After returning to Indonesia he established himself as a lawyer, nationalist, and, later, a figure for workers' rights. During the first twenty years of Indonesia's independence Iwa held several cabinet positions. After retiring he continued to write. In 2002 Iwa was declared a National Hero of Indonesia."
  POLITICS_SEYFFARDT_DESC:0 "Seijffardt was the son of August Lodewijk Willem Seyffardt, Minister of War in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Gijsbert van Tienhoven, and his wife Catharina Louisa de Hollander. Like his father, he chose a career as a professional soldier, and so at the age of fifteen he became a cadet at the Koninklijke Militaire Academie (KMA) in Breda. On graduation he was appointed second lieutenant at the Vestingartillerie (garrison artillery) in the Royal Netherlands Army, but returned to the KMA as a lecturer in 1900 at the age of 28. Alongside his teaching he studied at the Hogere Krijgsschool in Haarlem, in order to become qualified for a position within the General Staff. In 1928, as an interim step, he was appointed commander of the first division in the rank of Major General. A year later he was appointed Chief of the General Staff, promoted to lieutenant general a year later, remaining as chief of the General Staff latterly attached to the Central Intelligence (CI), part of GS III. He retired in May 1934, after a very meritorious career. In the build-up to World War II, he began to give lectures for the conservative Verbond voor Nationaal Herstel (Alliance for National Recovery - VNH) led by Van Gybland Oosterhoff. In 1937, Seyffardt became a member of the Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging (NSB), and started writing articles for their publication Volk en Vaderland. But after a year and a half, disillusioned with the infighting between Anton Mussert and Meinoud Rost van Tonningen, he resigned his membership. In October 1940 he attended a meeting of a Fascist group organised around the magazine De Waag."
  POLITICS_WILHELMINA_DESC:0 "was Queen of the Netherlands from 1890 until her abdication in 1948. She reigned for nearly 58 years, longer than any other Dutch monarch. Her reign saw the First and the Second World Wars, as well as the Dutch economic crisis of 1933. The only child of King William III of the Netherlands and Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, Wilhelmina ascended to the throne at the age of 10 after her father's death in 1890, under her mother's regency. After taking charge of government, Wilhelmina was generally popular for maintaining Dutch neutrality during the First World War and solving many of her country's industrial problems. By that time, her business ventures made her the world's first female billionaire in dollars. She ensured that her family was one of seven European royal houses remaining in existence. Following the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, Wilhelmina fled to Britain and took charge of the Dutch government-in-exile. She frequently spoke to the nation over radio and came to be regarded as a symbol of the resistance. By 1948, she had already returned to the liberated Netherlands and was the only survivor of the 16 monarchs who were sitting on their thrones at the time of her coronation. Increasingly beset by poor health, Wilhelmina abdicated in favour of her daughter Juliana in September 1948 and retired to Het Loo Palace, where she died in 1962."

 # Imperial State of Kansai
  POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "Emperor Showa has returned to the home of his ancient family. Decades of exile in the United Kingdom since the end of the Boshin War have come to an end. Since being smuggled back into the country with British backing via Osaka during the crisis in 1930, Emperor Showa has been growing ever more successful in his path to restoration. Once limited to little more than Kyoto, Hirohito’s cause has led to expansion through conquest and municipal defections alike. The history, promises and cause of the Monarchy have left few across the islands to outright despise the Young Emperor. But decades of Republican and Shogunate rule, combined with the reactionary cause that the imperial family backed during the Boshin War, has left Japan disillusioned with the perfection of monarchy. To many Hirohito is just another, albeit honourable, tyrant in this age of division."

  POLITICS_CATROUX_DESC:0 "Unlike the other European territory leaders, Georges Catroux is not primarily a diplomat. Instead, Catroux is first and foremost a general. Assigned to the effectively French-controlled sphere over Kobe, General Catroux’s main task and responsibility has firstly been to cement French military control over the city following the breakdown of Japan; secondly to actually govern it. Catroux would sooner die than relinquish Kobe to an invader without direct orders from his government. But with war looming on the home continent, is there any Catroux can do to stop such an event with a skeleton garrison to man the city?"

In which his actions by starting the Kyushu Naval Mutiny, ordering the forces under his command to establish maritime control over the island, triggered the establishment of the Naval Junta. Relatively more stable and moderately-minded than his counterparts in the army junta, Yamamoto is keen to protect his beloved navy from the hostile army command."

  POLITICS_IESATO_DESC:0 "Unknown throughout the Republican Era. Iesato was jettisoned into the theater of leadership amidst the 1930 July Crisis. With the isles in chaos, the Samurai aristocracy of central Japan hastily established their conservative rule in the region out of desperate preservation as violent communist uprisings swept across the corrupted republic. Their immediate choice was Tokugawa Iesato, the old shogun before their defeat during The Great War. Now the representative and protector of this ancient aristocracy, Iesato cannot afford to be known as the ruler to destroy the Shogunate twice."

  POLITICS_NOSAKA_DESC:0 "Calm, respectful and thoughtful. Sanzo Nosaka does not readily fit the stereotype of the fervorous and violent communist leader. Born to a wealthy merchant family, Sanzo’s entry into Marxist circles has brought about respect from many avenues of Communist thought. Committed to the standing policy of cooperation between the countless interpretations and agencies of the Japanese Communist movement, Sanzo has thus far prevented internal collapse and disunity but at the price of a clear direction. His more modest, reformist ideals have also left many to hold him responsible for the Communist uprising’s inability to take control over the entire country early into the Liberal Republic’s collapse. While relatively respected by those outside the movement, this growing popular dissatisfaction internally may stop even Nosaka from holding the communist groups together."
