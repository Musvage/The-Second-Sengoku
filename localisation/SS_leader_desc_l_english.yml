  POLITICS_GREW_DESC:0 "An experienced diplomat, having served as ambassador for America in a variety of countries, Grew effectively acts as governor to America’s Naval Base and territory at Chiba. Acting as the voice of the United States advising and pressuring policy changes within the Japanese Republic, whom the Americans have historically propped up, Joseph Grew is both loyal to his country and concerned with Japan’s current path. Worried that current American meddling over Japanese democracy is strengthening the cause of those who seek to destroy America’s creation outright, Joseph is more open than most other Western governors in Japan to the prospect of weakening their clutch over Japan."
  POLITICS_SORIANO_DESC:0 "Successful industrialist, especially in the alcohol market, Andrés Soriano is the Philanthropist of the Pacific. Ever caring for the wellbeing of his employees, Soriano takes the same care into account when charged with the protection of both the commercial and civil interests of American influences in Japan."
  POLITICS_KAWANANAKOA_DESC:0 "The claimant to the throne of Hawaii; Kawānanakoa has been established as the chief liaison in the Chiba concession for Japanese Imperial and American interests. Effectively operating as petty king for the American economically-dominated city."
  POLITICS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "Born in 1880, Douglas MacArthur is the son of Arthur MacArthur and a distant relative to Matthew Perry, The man who ended Japan’s era of total isolation. MacArthur’s history had a history with Japan prior to his current posting in Chiba. Particularly inspecting the status of American naval stations across Shogunate Japan prior to the First World War. With additional experience in operations across the Pacific area and in the political field, while simultaneously not being a high-standing commissioned officer, MacArthur has been an easy choice for military guidance over America’s peripheral operations in Japan."
  POLITICS_FUJIMOTO_DESC:0 "The ringleader of the Communist movement in Hawaii, Charles Fujimoto has struck a deal for American Chiba to continue as an autonomous authority over the region while maintaining ideological cohesion with Leftist Japan.

 # Chugoku Military Junta
  POLITICS_HATA_DESC:0 "The successor to Kazushige Ugaki, Hata now commands as a warlord of warlords. The very existence of his state is borne out of the armies confidence in their right to govern Japan as a principled and uncorrupted force. Yet the years of stagnation by the military machine in the South has rapidly degraded the internal strength of the Republic’s old army. Hata is a warlord trying to bring order to a government of other warlords An impossible task. Whether Hata’s conviction will see him through or his leadership shall fall to the ambitions of those he commands remains to be seen."
  POLITICS_MUTO_DESC:0 "A native of Kyushu, Akira Mutō became infamous among the military ranks of Chugoku for his increasingly hardline views on dealing with the opposition to the Military Junta’s efforts to restore order and clarity to Japanese governance. It was this trait as a stickler for order than made him an ideal candidate for the fascist, ultranationalist government that has settled itself within the military government."
  baronmuto:0 "Born to an ex-samurai family within the Saga Domain, Mutō’s family lost its place following the Shogunate victory during the Boshin war. His lineage has since never buried the hatchet it festered for their poor choice of allegiance during the war. Despite being a staunch military man, Nobuyoshi Mutō has consequently made an ideal candidate to form a Pro-Royalist authority within the original military staff of Japan."
  POLITICS_HAMAI_DESC:0 "A relatively low-level civil servant within the civil administration for Hiroshima city under its military authority. Hamai become popular for his peripheral role in Pro-Democracy circles within Chugoku while it was under martial rule. With Chugoku now under its new democratic authority, Shinzo has been placed in charge of the local autonomous government to represent the interests of his people."
  POLITICS_YAMAKAWA_DESC:0 "A committed socialist, Hitoshi has come to power in his native region due to his past role in organising the Communist uprisings that occurred in Chugoku during the collapse of Japan. Still a popular among the socialists who have silently awaited his return, Hitoshi has now been charged with building up Marxist governance within the local communities and handling the reactionary influences embedded within the area."
  POLITICS_FUJITA_DESC:0 "The prominent civil servant for Hiroshima until gaining his present post, Wakami Fujita was notably apolitical during the military governance of Chugoku. Neither protesting their rule nor condoning it. His acceptance to contribute his experiences and abilities towards the Democratic Socialist elements who have taken prominence within Chugoku politics is therefore of little surprise."

  POLITICS_KATAYAMA_DESC:0 "The Social-Democratic Leader of the Ezo Republic, Tetsu has come to rule Ezo as a comfortable bridge between the winds of socialist change that swept through the Japanese Republic in 1930 and continued respect for the old democratic system prior to the July Crisis. While not at regular odds with the politics of the Tokyo government, President Katayama has continued to serve as one of the few regime leaders in Japan prepared to reconcile and cooperate with the Republic."
  POLITICS_ARAKI_DESC:0 "A descendant of the Samurai and born in Tokyo, Araki has become one of the many ethnic Japanese occupants of Ezo. Having traveled there as part of an arrangement for him to take the reins of protecting the nation under the Provisional Government’s reunification, Araki has taken full control as a result of the loose coalition of Rightist and the Ainu tribe-folk taking power."
  POLITICS_KIDO_DESC:0 "Born in Tokyo, one might be surprised to see Koichi in power within Hokkaido. But the Ezo Republic’s predominant electorate are the ethnic Japanese of the island; who do not particularly care if their representative is a local. Having previously worked in the civil service for agriculture, Kido is extremely familiar with the agricultural aspects of Hokkaido and as such has been placed in charge to protect the island’s economy."
  POLITICS_KITOKURO_DESC:0 "A native to modern day Kakegawa, Baron Kitokuro was neither born during the days before the Emperor’s exile nor held any particular fanatical monarchist values during the days of the Shogun running solo. However, his recent defection from the civil service to the political opportunities in the Kyoto government has seen him reach a position of interim governor for Ezo until it can be restored to the fold of the Empire of the Rising Sun."
  POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "A fervent anti-communist within the Siberian White Russians armies, Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov became the ringleader for the organisation of the exiled white russian troops and officers that fled to the safety of Northern Japan following their defeats in the Russian Far East. His militarist determination has since seen him rise to power; committed to rallying the Russian Right for one last majorly organised effort to contest Soviet power in Mother Russia."
  POLITICS_ISOO_DESC:0 "The renowned Christian Leftist, Abe Isoo, has been placed upon the gubernatorial chair of the Republic of Ezo. Known for his staunch commitment to peaceful change.

Now assigned to the management of the Dutch governorate in Hirado, which the Netherlands seized less than five years before the total collapse of the Republic.

A year later he was appointed Chief of the General Staff, promoted to lieutenant general a year later, remaining as chief of the General Staff latterly attached to the Central Intelligence (CI), part of GS III. He retired in May 1934, after a very meritorious career. In the build-up to World War II, he began to give lectures for the conservative Verbond voor Nationaal Herstel (Alliance for National Recovery - VNH) led by Van Gybland Oosterhoff. In 1937, Seyffardt became a member of the Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging (NSB), and started writing articles for their publication Volk en Vaderland.

  POLITICS_WILHELMINA_DESC:0 "was Queen of the Netherlands from 1890 until her abdication in 1948. She reigned for nearly 58 years, longer than any other Dutch monarch. Her reign saw the First and the Second World Wars, as well as the Dutch economic crisis of 1933. The only child of King William III of the Netherlands and Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, Wilhelmina ascended to the throne at the age of 10 after her father's death in 1890, under her mother's regency. After taking charge of government, Wilhelmina was generally popular for maintaining Dutch neutrality during the First World War and solving many of her country's industrial problems. By that time, her business ventures made her the world's first female billionaire in dollars. She ensured that her family was one of seven European royal houses remaining in existence. Following the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, Wilhelmina fled to Britain and took charge of the Dutch government-in-exile. She frequently spoke to the nation over radio and came to be regarded as a symbol of the resistance. By 1948, she had already returned to the liberated Netherlands and was the only survivor of the 16 monarchs who were sitting on their thrones at the time of her coronation. Increasingly beset by poor health, Wilhelmina abdicated in favour of her daughter Juliana in September 1948 and retired to Het Loo Palace, where she died in 1962."

  POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "Emperor Showa has returned to the home of his ancient family. Decades of exile in the United Kingdom since the end of the Boshin War have come to an end. Since being smuggled back into the country with British backing via Osaka during the crisis in 1930, Emperor Showa has been growing ever more successful in his path to restoration. Once limited to little more than Kyoto, Hirohito’s cause has led to expansion through conquest and municipal defections alike. The history, promises and cause of the Monarchy have left few across the islands to outright despise the Young Emperor. But decades of Republican and Shogunate rule, combined with the reactionary cause that the imperial family backed during the Boshin War, has left Japan disillusioned with the perfection of monarchy. To many Hirohito is just another, albeit honourable, tyrant in this age of division."
  POLITICS_KOTOHITO_DESC:0 "Prince Kotohito was born in Kyoto on November 10, 1865 as the sixteenth son of Prince Fushimi Kuniye (1802–1875). His father was the twentieth head of the Fushimi-no-miya, one of the four shinnōke, branches of the Imperial Family which were eligible to succeed to the throne if the main line should die out. Since the infant mortality rate in the main imperial household was quite high, Emperor Kōmei, the father of Emperor Meiji, adopted Prince Kotohito as a potential heir. Prince Kotohito was thus the adopted brother of Emperor Meiji and a great uncle to both Emperor Shōwa and his consort, Empress Kōjun. Prince Kotohito was initially sent to Sambō-in monzeki temple at the age of three to be raised as a Buddhist monk, but was selected in 1872 to revive the Kan'in-no-miya, another of the shinnōke households, which had gone extinct upon the death of the fifth head, Prince Naruhito."

In 1921, Sempill led an official military mission to Japan that showcased the latest British aircraft.

He was eventually forced to retire from the Royal Navy in 1941 after being discovered passing on secret material to Tokyo shortly before Japan declared war in the Pacific. Sempill was known as "Master of Sempill" before succeeding his father to the titles of Lord Sempill and Baronet of Craigevar in 1934."

Yoshizawa later served as Japanese ambassador to France and official representative to the League of Nations. He was appointed to the cabinet of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi as Foreign Minister from 14 January 1932 to 26 May 1932.

  POLITICS_CATROUX_DESC:0 "Unlike the other European territory leaders, Georges Catroux is not primarily a diplomat. Instead, Catroux is first and foremost a general. Assigned to the effectively French-controlled sphere over Kobe, General Catroux’s main task and responsibility has firstly been to cement French military control over the city following the breakdown of Japan; secondly to actually govern it. Catroux would sooner die than relinquish Kobe to an invader without direct orders from his government. But with war looming on the home continent, is there any Catroux can do to stop such an event with a skeleton garrison to man the city?"

After retiring from the Navy, he was appointed in 1939 by his close friend President Franklin D. Roosevelt as Governor of Puerto Rico.

Bossard dropped out of school when his stepfather could no longer afford it and became a store clerk. Despite his lack of education, Bossard became interested in radios, building his first one at sixteen. In the 1930s, Bossard joined the British Union of Fascists, but felt himself out of place among people whom he regarded as upper-class. Eventually, he saved enough money to attend radio technology courses at Norwich Technical College. When he ran out of money, he was arrested for attempting to cash a forged cheque in 1934.

He explored the business of fighting, in terms of the relationship between warfare and social, political, and economic factors in the civilian sector. Fuller emphasised the potential of new weapons, especially tanks and aircraft, to stun a surprised enemy psychologically.

  POLITICS_EDWARD_DESC:0 "was King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Empire, and Emperor of India, from 20 January 1936 until his abdication in December of the same year. Edward was born during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria as the eldest child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George V and Queen Mary. He was created Prince of Wales on his sixteenth birthday, seven weeks after his father succeeded as king. As a young man, Edward served in the British Army during the First World War and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father. While Prince of Wales, he engaged in a series of affairs that worried his father and British prime minister Stanley Baldwin. Edward became king on his father's death. As king, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing to Wallis Simpson, an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the Church of England, which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew the Baldwin government would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would have ruined his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch. When it became apparent he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, he abdicated. He was succeeded by his younger brother, George VI. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history. After his abdication, Edward was created Duke of Windsor. He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. Later that year, the couple toured Germany. During the Second World War, Edward was at first stationed with the British Military Mission to France, but after private accusations that he was a Nazi sympathiser, he was appointed Governor of the Bahamas. After the war, Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France. He and Wallis remained married until his death in 1972. Wallis died 14 years later."

  POLITICS_SUZUKI_DESC:0 "Suzuki was born in Gamagori, Aichi Prefecture, to a family descended from medieval hatamoto; however, his father had lost the family's fortune, and as a result Suzuki was forced to work his way through school. He attended Waseda University and graduated with a degree in politics and economics in 1915. After graduation, he wrote for several newspapers, including the Hochi Shimbun, Taishō Nichi Nichi Shimbun, and Mainichi Shimbun, becoming well known as a business writer. In 1918, Suzuki was a war correspondent during the Japanese intervention in Siberia where his sympathies were with the Bolshevik movement, and was later known as a consistent opponent of Japan's war efforts. Afterwards, Suzuki returned to the Soviet Union several times, and developed a socialist worldview based on his Soviet experiences and his memories of his impoverished childhood. As Japan became increasingly militarist, Suzuki devoted most of his energies to the socialist movement starting around 1928. With Katō Kanjū, he formed the Proletarian Workers' Conference in 1936 and the Japan Proletarian Party in 1937. However, Suzuki became an increasingly prominent target of the government, and he was arrested in 1937 under the Peace Preservation Laws. Until the end of World War II, he was prohibited from public political activity. Following Japan's surrender in 1945, the Japan Socialist Party was formed, and Suzuki, still known as a prominent left-wing leader, joined the party. In 1946, he won a seat in the House of Representatives; he became party secretary in 1949 and chairman in 1951. As chairman of the lower house's Budget Committee in 1948, Suzuki passed a veto over Katayama Tetsu's proposed budget, which later led to the downfall of the cabinet. Later, in his inaugural speech as party chairman, he famously said "Young men, do not take up arms," which caused a huge political stir and became a rallying cry of the pacifist movement in Japan, although it was only intended to rebuke Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru's attempt to secure aid from the United States to rebuild the military of Japan. After the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1952, the Socialist Party split into left and right wings. Suzuki remained chairman of the left wing, which had only 16 seats in the House of Representatives; in the 1955 elections, it jumped to 89 seats, thanks to support from the General Council of Trade Unions and popular support from a war-weary electorate that largely agreed with the party's principle of unarmed neutrality. The two socialist parties reunited that year to form a united front against the emerging right-wing conservative Liberal Democratic Party, but crippling defeats in 1957 and 1958 reignited the left-right tension within the Socialist Party. In 1960, right-wing leaders such as Suehiro Nishio left the party and formed the Democratic Socialist Party. Taking responsibility for the party's collapse, Suzuki resigned as chairman. During the 1960s, Suzuki gradually pressed the Socialist Party to the left, but it continued to languish as Japan's economic recovery sped up. He retired from politics in 1967 and died of liver cirrhosis in 1970."

  POLITICS_SILVA_DESC:0 "He was born in Cristelo ( Barcelos ), diocese of Braga , into a rural middle class family, being the son of Adelino da Costa e Silva and Adelaide Varzim da Cunha e Silva. He entered the school where his mother was a teacher, having completed “primary education”, with the fourth grade exam, in July 1912 , at the age of ten. Wanting to be a priest , he had to enter the high school of Póvoa de Varzim , as there was no minor seminary in Braga, as it had been militarily occupied in 1911 . In 1916 , when he finished high school, this problem was solved and Abel Varzim completed his preparatory studies. In 1921, he entered the Conciliar Seminary of that city, where he graduated in Theology , having celebrated “Missa Nova”, on July 3, 1925 , in Póvoa de Varzim. In response to a request from the Bishop of Beja , D. José do Patrocínio Dias , the prelate Bracarense, D. Manuel Vieira de Matos , yields the new priest to the Diocese of Beja, having been placed in the Minor Seminary of Serpa as a teacher and prefect, since its inauguration on November 21, 1925. There he taught for five years and applied his dynamism, having even supported the initiative of the Seminary Educational Team, in the foundation of the scout group nº 38 (Beato Nuno Álvares Pereira) of the CNS (National Scout Corps - current National Scout Corps), of which he was appointed Chief. After this stay in Serpa, he went to the University of Leuven , Belgium , which opened up new perspectives and opened wider horizons. Four years later, on April 23, 1934, he received a doctorate in Political and Social Sciences. For his thesis, Abel Varzim chose the theme Boerenbond (League of Farmers), which he named “Le Boerenbond Belge”, and in which he proceeds to study and evaluate that Belgian Catholic agrarian structure, facing the set of problems in the world rural, in a vision both corporate and cooperative. This thesis was edited by the House «DESCLÉE DE BROUWER ET Cie», in Paris, in 1934, and printed at his home in Bruges . He took advantage of his stay in Leuven to complement his training, participating in numerous Congresses and Social Weeks , deepening the study of the Social Encyclicals of Leo XIII and Pius XI , and also having private with entities as diverse as Jacques Maritain and Joseph Cardijn , founder of JOC (Catholic Workers Youth) and with Hergé , author of “ Tintim ”, etc. From his stay, he reaped his interest in social issues, an issue that indelibly marked all his future action. Returning to Portugal, he drafted, with Father Manuel Rocha , the Statutes of Portuguese Catholic Action (ACP), striving for it to be made up of specialized bodies, youth and adults, and farmers, workers, university students, etc. The document, despite opposition from the Portuguese State, was approved by the Holy See . In 1934, he was invited by his primary school and seminary companion, Fr. Lopes da Cruz, who was in Lisbon responsible for writing the daily "News", and the magazine "Renascença", and guiding the campaign for the creation of Rádio Renaissance to dedicate himself to these tasks, being, therefore, one of its founders, having started its regular broadcasts in January 1937. He was also at the foundation of the Catholic Operative League, the ACP Specialized Body, officially created on June 30, 1935, and which started its activity in 1936, of which he was Assistant General until 1948. He was the great impeller of the newspaper “O Worker”, to which he dedicated himself after soul and heart; this newspaper, from the Catholic Action Workers' Organizations, was to be suspended by verbal communication from the «Censorship Services» to the editor in chief, Manuel Alpiarça, on July 9, 1948, when he went there in search of the “original target” by that entity, after having long waited for it. This suspension occurred, unsuccessful the attempts that the “authorities” (read National Union) undertook to bribe and / or “domesticate” it. During his time at Acção Católica, he developed an intense activity, with emphasis on the defense and promotion of social justice. Upon his return to Portugal, deeply interested in social problems, and aware of the structural backwardness in which the country found itself, he welcomed the solution imposed by Salazar , from a Corporate Unitary State, accepting for this reason the “National Labor Statute” . However, he soon found that he was mistaken, and that the Estado Novo regime did not respond to the problems that afflicted workers, and the common Portuguese. He was a deputy to the National Assembly , in the 1938/1942 legislature, becoming famous for a “Notice-Prior” that he presented there on February 17, 1939, on National Unions, in which he criticized certain aspects of the corporate union organization, mentioned the action of the National Institute of Labor and Welfare, and in particular its ineffectiveness in many aspects. This passage through the National Assembly was also marked by the intervention he made, on February 6, 1941, "manifesting his disagreement" with the terms of Decree-Law no. 31,107, which regulated the economic conditions of the military service in marriage . The attacks and threats he then faced drove him away from the ideas of the Estado Novo. Then he began to know the bitter paths of political persecution (and not only), while carrying out training actions for university workers and students, with what we would today call “training for citizenship”. In early 1939, he was appointed director of the Economic-Social Secretariat, an organ of Catholic Action , whose purpose was to exercise social activities. He left those roles in 1948."

In 1907 the young Monsaraz began studying law whilst also writing for the right-wing journal Pátria Nova. As a result of his involvement in monarchist politics it would be 1915 before he finally graduated. Like many young monarchists at the time Monsaraz fell in behind Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro and took part in his monarchist incursion in 1911. He was exiled to Paris for his involvement and fell in with other like-minded individuals in the French capital who had also been expelled from Portugal. He was the founder of Integralismo Lusitano in 1914 along with José Hipólito Raposo, José Adriano Pequito Rebelo and António Sardinha. Independently wealthy due to coming from a leading family, Monsaraz was involved in funding a number of journals associated with the new movement, including Nação Portuguesa, Ideia Nacional and A Monarquista. Monsaraz took part in Paiva Couceiro's second rebellion of 1919 but was wounded in this conflict and lost a kidney, a fact that impaired his health for the rest of his life. Nonetheless he continued his involvement in Integralism and sat on the Junta Central of the movement. He would become closely associated with Luís de Almeida Braga in their support for Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza. The issue of succession proved a divisive one, with different elements within the movement supporting different candidates for the throne, and in 1925 Monsaraz resigned from the Junta Central as part of these problems. Following his resignation Monsaraz began to read the works of Georges Sorel and his disciple Georges Valois and soon became converted to national syndicalism as a result. He went on to become a leading figure in the Movimento Nacional-Sindicalista, becoming Secretary-General of the blue-shirted movement in 1933. However Monsaraz was exiled to Republican Spain along with Francisco Rolão Preto in 1935 when António de Oliveira Salazar stepped up his persecution of the National Syndicalists."

Once established in Portugal, the Duke was granted a pension and residence by the Fundação da Casa de Bragança, the organization has owned and managed all the private assets of the House of Braganza, since the death of King Manuel II, in 1932. Duarte Nuno spent the rest of his life attempting, without success, the restoration of all Brigantine assets to his family and recreating the image of the Miguelist Braganzas in Portuguese society, all under the goal of the restoration of the Portuguese monarchy, under the Braganzas. In 1942, the Duarte Nuno married Princess Maria Francisca of Orléans-Braganza, daughter of Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará. Their marriage reconciled two branches of the House of Braganza, in two different ways, reuniting the Portuguese and Brazilian Brigantine houses and specifically reuniting the Miguelist and Liberal Braganzas, which had been estranged since 1828, when the War of Two Brothers was waged between King-Emperor Pedro IV & I, founder of the Liberal Braganzas, and King Miguel I, founder of the Miguelist Braganzas.

His commander was General Wilhelm von Urach, who was elected king of Lithuania in 1918 as Mindaugas II of Lithuania. Before Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany (1933), Ott had been the adjutant of General Kurt von Schleicher. In 1934, he was sent to Tokyo as military attaché at the German embassy. In early September 1940, Heinrich Georg Stahmer arrived in Tokyo to assist Ott in negotiating the Tripartite Pact with Japan. Stahmer later replaced Ott as ambassador when Richard Sorge, who had been working for Ott in Japan as an agent for the Abwehr, was unmasked as a Soviet spy in Japan in late 1941. Prange suggests in his analysis of Sorge that Sorge was so entirely trusted by Ott that he was allowed access to top secret cables from Berlin in the embassy.

He studied medicine (and sporadically economics, history of literature and arts) eventually graduating from the University of Leipzig in 1931 with a dissertation on a study of German medical reform in 1848. Throughout his studies Ackerknecht was affiliated with communist student groups in Freiburg, Berlin and Vienna; in 1926 he joined the KJVT (Kommunistisher Jugendverband Deutschlands; Communist Youth Federation of Germany) and then the KPD (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands; Communist Party of Germany). As a student he was known as the leader of the KoStyFra (Kommunistische Studentenfraktion; Communist Student's Fraction). Together with Robert Soblen and Otto Schüssler he founded in 1928 a small oppositional group at Leipzig called the Bolschewistische Einheit (Bolshevik Unity). He was also affiliated with the Lenin League. In March 1934, Ackerknecht became one of the founding members of the United Left Opposition. Meanwhile, he was expelled from the KPD. After having moved from Leipzig to Berlin, he became a member of the 'political committee' of the Left Opposition of the KPD, the "Bolshevists-Leninists, the official German branch of the International Left Opposition led by Leon Trotsky and his son Lev Sedov. Ackerknecht closely co-operated with Sedov, Grylewicz and other prominent activists of the Trotskyist movement and became a co-editor and staff writer of the LO using the pseudonym Bauer. When the Nazis seized power in Germany, Ackerknecht, now one of the central figures of German Trotskyism, went underground. He fled Germany in June 1933, spent a short time in Czechoslovakia and paid visit to Leon Trotsky in exile in Turkey. He eventually broke with Trotskyism and Marxism and turned his back to political activism. However, his opposition against Nazism and right wing politics of all kinds remained unrelenting. While in exile in Paris he earned his living as a translator and began to study ethnography at the Musée de l'Homme with Marcel Mauss, Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, and Paul Rivet. He graduated from the Sorbonne shortly before the outbreak of World War II. He joined the French army and eventually fled to southern France where he waited for several months for his American visa.

  POLITICS_TOJO_DESC:0 "Hideki Tojo was born in the Kōjimachi district of Tokyo on December 30, 1884, as the third son of Hidenori Tojo, a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army. Under the bakufu, Japanese society was divided rigidly into four castes; the merchants, artisans, peasants and the samurai. After the Meiji Restoration, the caste system was abolished in 1871, but the former caste distinctions in many ways persisted afterwards, ensuring that those from the former samurai caste continued to enjoy their traditional prestige. The Tojo family came from the samurai caste, though the Tojos were relatively lowly warrior retainers for the great daimyōs (lords) that they had served for generations. Tojo's father was a samurai turned Army officer and his mother was the daughter of a Buddhist priest, making his family very respectable, but poor. Hideki had an education typical of a Japanese youth in the Meiji era. The purpose of the Meiji educational system was to train the boys to be soldiers as adults, and the message was relentlessly drilled into Japanese students that war was the most beautiful thing in the entire world, that the Emperor was a living god and that the greatest honor for a Japanese man was to die for the Emperor. Japanese girls were taught that the highest honor for a woman was to have as many sons as possible who could die for the Emperor in war. As a boy, Tojo was known for his stubbornness, lack of a sense of humor, for being an opinionated and combative youth fond of getting into fights with the other boys and for his tenacious way of pursuing what he wanted. Japanese schools in the Meiji era were very competitive, and there was no tradition of sympathy for failure; those who did so were often bullied by the teachers. Those who knew him during his formative years deemed him to be of only average intelligence. However, he was known to compensate for his observed lack of intellect with a willingness to work extremely hard. Tojo's boyhood hero was the 17th-century shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu who issued the injunction, "Avoid the things you like, turn your attention to unpleasant duties". Tojo liked to say, "I am just an ordinary man possessing no shining talents. Anything I have achieved I owe to my capacity for hard work and never giving up". In 1899, Tojo enrolled in the Army Cadet School. In 1905, Tojo shared in the general outrage in Japan at the Treaty of Portsmouth, which ended the war with Russia, and which the Japanese people saw as a betrayal as the war did not end with Japan annexing Siberia as popular opinion had demanded. The Treaty of Portsmouth was so unpopular that it set off anti-American riots known as the Hibiya incendiary incident as many Japanese were enraged at the way the Americans had apparently cheated Japan as the Japanese gains in the treaty were far less than what public opinion had expected. Very few Japanese at the time had understood that the war with Russia had pushed their nation to the verge of bankruptcy, and most people in Japan believed that the American president Theodore Roosevelt who had mediated the Treaty of Portsmouth had cheated Japan out of its rightful gains. Tojo's anger at the Treaty of Portsmouth left him with an abiding dislike of Americans. In 1909, Hideki married Katsuko Ito, with whom he had three sons (Hidetake, Teruo, and Toshio) and four daughters (Mitsue, Makie, Sachie and Kimie). Upon graduating from the Japanese Military Academy (ranked 10th of 363 cadets) in March 1905, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry of the IJA. In 1918–19, Tojo briefly served in Siberia as part of the Japanese expeditionary force sent to intervene in the Russian Civil War. Tojo served as Japanese military attache to Germany between 1919 and 1922. As the Imperial Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, the Japanese Army was always very strongly influenced by intellectual developments in the German Army, and Tojo was no exception. In the 1920s, the German military favored preparing for the next war by creating a totalitarian Wehrstaat (Defense State), an idea that was taken up by the Japanese military as the "national defense state". In 1922, on his way home to Japan, Tojo took a train ride across the United States, his first and only visit to America, which left him with the impression that the Americans were a materialistic "soft" people devoted only to making money and to hedonistic pursuits like sex, partying and (despite Prohibition) drinking. Tojo boasted that his only hobby was his work, and he customarily brought home his paperwork to work late into the night, and he refused to have any part in raising his children, which he viewed both as a distraction from his work and a woman's work, having his wife do all the work of taking care of his children. A stern, humorless man, Tojo was known for his brusque manner, his obsession with etiquette, and for his coldness. Like almost all Japanese officers at the time, Tojo routinely slapped the faces of the men under his command when giving orders, saying that face-slapping was a "means of training" men who came from families that were not part of the samurai caste, and for whom bushido was not second nature. In 1924, Tojo was greatly offended by the Immigration Control Act passed by the American Congress banning all Asian immigration into the United States with many Congressmen and Senators openly saying the act was necessary because the Asians worked harder than whites. Tojo wrote with bitterness at the time that American whites would never accept Asians as equals and "It (the Immigration Control Act) shows how the strong will always put their own interests first. Japan, too, has to be strong to survive in the world". By 1928, he was bureau chief of the Japanese Army and was shortly thereafter promoted to colonel. He began to take an interest in militarist politics during his command of the 8th Infantry Regiment. Reflecting the imagery often used in Japan to describe people in power, Tojo told his officers that they were to be both a "father" and a "mother" to the men under their command. Tojo often visited the homes of the men under his command, assisted his men with personal problems and made loans to officers short of money. Like many other Japanese officers, Tojo disliked Western cultural influence in Japan, which was often disparaged as resulting in the ero-guro-nansensu ("eroticism, grotesquerie and nonsense") movement as he complained about such forms of "Western decadence" like young couples holding hands and kissing in public, which were undermining traditional values necessary to uphold the kokutai."
  POLITICS_OHIRA_DESC:0 "was a Japanese politician who was Prime Minister of Japan from 1978 to 1980. Ōhira's time in office was cut short when he died in office; he remains the most recent Japanese Prime Minister to die in office. He was born in present-day Kan'onji, Kagawa and attended Hitotsubashi University. At the apex of his political life, Ōhira came to represent what were known as "mainstream factions" within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) which put him at odds with Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, who led what were known as an "anti-mainstream" faction. Ōhira served as foreign minister in the cabinet of Kakuei Tanaka until mid-July 1974. In a cabinet reshuffle in July 1974, he was replaced by Toshio Kimura as foreign minister and then appointed the finance minister, replacing Takeo Fukuda. Ōhira was elected to the presidency of the LDP in late 1978. On 7 December 1978, he was appointed 68th Prime Minister, successfully pushing Takeo Fukuda from his position. Ōhira was the sixth Christian to hold this office after Hara Takashi, Takahashi Korekiyo, Ichirō Hatoyama, Tetsu Katayama, and Shigeru Yoshida. In the general election of 1979, the LDP narrowly failed to win an outright majority, but enough independent members of the Diet joined the party to enable Ōhira to remain in office, and he was duly reappointed on 9 November of that year. On 16 May 1980, a vote of no confidence was held in the Diet. Ōhira expected the motion to fail, and was visibly shaken when it passed 243–187. 69 members of his own LDP, including Fukuda, abstained. Given the choice of resigning or calling new elections, Ōhira chose the latter and began campaigning for LDP candidates. He was hospitalized for exhaustion on 31 May and died of a massive heart attack 12 days later. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Ito acted in Ōhira's place as deputy after his death. Yoshio Sakurauchi, the Secretary General of LDP, led the LDP to its greatest victory in fifteen years, capitalizing on the "sympathy vote" generated by Ōhira's death. The Prime Minister was succeeded by Zenkō Suzuki after the election."

He still has a high reputation as the archetype of a behind-the-scenes power broker, and at the zenith of their power there were times when both Kanemaru Shin and Hiromu Nonaka were openly complimented by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone for having "surpassed Bukichi Miki".

  POLITICS_SEIGO_DESC:0 "was a political leader in Imperial Japan who advocated a fascist regime for Japan to complete the Meiji Restoration. Nakano sought to bring about a rebirth of Japan through a blend of the samurai ethic, Neo-Confucianism, and populist nationalism modeled on European fascism. He saw Saigō Takamori as epitomizing the 'true spirit' of the Meiji ishin, and the task of modern Japan to recapture it. Nakano formed the Kokumin Dōmei (National Alliance) with Adachi Kenzō in December 1932. He left this group with a splinter group to form the Tōhōkai ("Far East Society"; see their flag here) in May 1936. In December 1937, Nakano had a personal audience with Benito Mussolini. In the next month, he met with Adolf Hitler and Joachim Ribbentrop. In January 1939, Nakano gave a speech on the need for a totalitarian Japan. He argued against those who "say that neither fascism nor Nazism are appropriate for our nation." He then distinguished between old-style conservative despotism, and a "Totalitarianism... based on essentials." Arguing against majority rule (as the majority "is the precise cause of contemporary decadence") and "an individualism which shows no concern for others", he calls for a "government going beyond democracy" giving consideration to "the essence of human beings." With organic unification of individuals "sharing common ideals and a common way of feeling," there can be formed "a perfect national organization." On 16 February 1942, British diplomats secretly proposed a peace deal with Japan. A possible agreement was that if Britain formally recognised the authority of Imperial Japan over North China and Manchuria, the Japanese would return the Malay Peninsula and Singapore to Britain. At the same time as this diplomatic movement, a political confrontation was in progress between Tōhōkai and the Kōdōha party. This was possibly the last internal political power struggle in the government before the Midway and Coral Sea defeats in 1942, which sent the Japanese armed forces reeling. As leader of the ultranationalist Tōhōkai, Nakano had some political influence at the time. He expressed his support and confidence for the Imperial Japanese Navy. He anxiously awaited the approval of the peace talks, so as to stabilize the recent conquests in Southeast Asia. Nakano also wanted to prevent any further sacrifices by the Japanese people towards the war effort, and pressured the government to drop what he considered to be the overly-ambitious aim of conquering all of Asia. On the other side was the largely pro-Imperialist faction, which represented the military interests of Japan and was led by General Hideki Tōjō. They reasoned that the extremely rapid successes in recent campaigns in Southeast Asia should be continued into the rest of Asia and even Australia before the Allies could react, to further develop the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. General Tōjō rejected any form of peace processes in the conquered lands and gave authorization for more conquests. This angered and frustrated Nakano and the Tōhōkai, who saw the rejection as a lost opportunity for Japan to maintain and consolidate its new territorial gains in Southeast Asia in the long term, and before the United States launched counter-offensives. Verbally critical of the Tōjō regime, Nakano was forbidden to publish articles or make public speeches. He was placed under house arrest, and committed seppuku (ritual suicide) on 27 October 1943."

He served as the 16th Governor-General of Taiwan from 1932 to 1936 and presided over the Taiwanese exposition (台湾博覧会) of 1935. Nakagawa implemented limited self-rule in Taiwan by allowing Taiwanese and Japanese residents to vote for half of the membership of local assemblies, although these assemblies were still subject to extensive control by the governor-general. In 1936, Nakagawa returned to Japan as a member of the House of Peers. In 1939 he was appointed president of Imperial Japanese Airways, the state-run airline of the Japanese Empire.

He was invited to Tokyo by Suematsu Kenchō to stay at the residence of the former Mōri clan to help edit a history of the Meiji Restoration. Afterwards, he went to work for the Yorozu Morning News, where he began to support social justice causes and pacifism. In 1903, Sakai established the socialist organization Heiminsha, together with Shūsui Kōtoku and Uchimura Kanzō. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Yorozu Morning News adopted a pro-government stance, and Sakai quit to form the weekly Heimin Shimbun together with Shūsui Kōtoku, which was critical of the war and decried the high taxes which the war was causing. It also published a Japanese translation of the Communist Manifesto in its November 13, 1904, issue. Sakai was sentenced to two months in jail. Sakai was also a strong supporter of the Esperanto movement, helping create the Japana Esperanto-Instituto in 1906. In 1906, Sakai became one of the founding members of the Japan Socialist Party.

  POLITICS_MITSURU_DESC:0 "was a Japanese right wing and ultranationalist founder of Genyosha (Black Ocean Society) and Kokuryukai (Black Dragon Society). Tōyama was a strong advocate of Pan Asianism (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere). Tōyama was born to a poor samurai family in Fukuoka City in Kyūshū. In his youth, he fought in the Saga Rebellion of 1874. In 1881, Tōyama became one of the founders of the Genyosha, a secret society and terrorist organization whose agenda was to agitate for Japanese military expansion and conquest of the Asian continent. The society attracted disaffected ex-samurai, and also figures involved in organized crime to assist in its campaigns of violence and assassination against foreigners and left-wing politicians. In 1889, Tōyama and the Genyosha were implicated in the attempted assassination of foreign minister Ōkuma Shigenobu. Tōyama was both a founder and one-time head of the Black Dragon Society. Immediately prior to the start of the First Sino-Japanese War, Tōyama organized the Tenyukyo, a secret society and paramilitary force that operated in Korea prior to the arrival of the Imperial Japanese Army, making detailed topographic maps, scouting out Chinese and Korean military installations and deployment, and arranging for logistic support. Along with Genyosha operatives in Korea and Manchuria, the Tenyukyo provided interpreters and guides to the regular Japanese army after their invasion. Tōyama was a strong supporter of Japanese control over Manchuria, and joined forces with the anti-Russian Tairo Doshikai movement in 1903. He also supported the Chinese republican revolutionaries against the Qing dynasty and gave considerable support to Sun Yat-sen. When the Chinese revolution began in 1911, he went to China in person as an advisor and to personally oversee Genyosha activities and to provide assistance to Sun Yat-sen. Following the Chinese revolution, Tōyama officially retired, and apparently refused to play an active role in the Black Dragon Society (Kokuryu-Kai) that he helped create as a successor to the Genyosha. He remained an influential behind-the-scenes figure in Japanese politics during the following years. In the 1930s, he was considered as a superpatriot by a large section of the Japanese public, including the military. In 1932, after the assassination of several "liberal" political figures, and following rumors that then Premier Saito and others were to be assassinated in turn, the government had Tōyama's house raided and searched, and his son arrested - leading to a momentary pacification of the situation. Although Tōyama remained a private citizen all his life, he was known as the "Shadow Shogun," "Spymaster," and "The Boss of Bosses," because of his tremendous covert influence on the nationalist politics and the yakuza crime syndicates. He also wrote an influential book on the "Three Shu" (Katsu Kaishu, Takahashi Deishu, and Yamaoka Tesshu). Despite his ultranationalism, Tōyama was paradoxically on good terms with Onisaburo Deguchi, Japan's most fervent pacifist. Tōyama was charismatic, complex, and controversial figure in his lifetime, and remains so to this day. He died in 1944 at his summer home on Gotemba, Shizuoka Prefecture, at the base of Mount Fuji. Radio Tokyo announced that funeral services lasting more than three hours were held for him in Tokyo."

With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Hayashi participated in the Siege of Port Arthur. Hayashi's first major command from 1918 to 1920 was as commanding officer of the IJA 57th Infantry Regiment, followed by a time in 1921 attached to the Technical Research Headquarters and as an acting Military Investigator. From 1921 to 1923 he was the head of the Preparatory Course at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, followed by a time attached to the Inspectorate General of Military Training. From 1923 to 1924 he was the Japanese Army Representative to the League of Nations, followed by another stint attached to the Inspectorate General of Military Training from 1924 to 1925. In 1925, Hayashi became the commanding Officer of the IJA 2nd Infantry Brigade. In 1926 he was made Commandant of the Tokyo Bay Fortress. In 1927, he became the Commandant of the Army War College, followed in 1928 as Deputy Inspector-General of Military Training. Finally in 1929 he became the General Officer Commanding the Imperial Guards Division. In 1930, Lieutenant-General Senjūrō Hayashi, was made Commander in Chief of the Japanese Korean Army. On the day after the Mukden Incident on 19 September, he ordered the IJA 20th Division to split its force, forming the 39th Mixed Brigade. Acting without authorization by the Emperor or central government in Tokyo, Hayashi ordered the 39th Mixed Brigade to cross the Yalu River that same day into Manchuria. The Cabinet was forced to concede the point to the military afterwards and the movement of the 39th Mixed Brigade from Korea was authorized on 22 September. Following his command in Korea, Hayashi was made Inspector General of Military Training and a member of the Supreme War Council from 1932 to 1934. In 1932, he was awarded with the Order of the Sacred Treasure (1st class) and in 1934, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class). From 1934 to 1935 Hayashi was Army Minister, and again member of the Supreme War Council from 1935 until his retirement the next year. As Army Minister, Hayashi was a supporter of Major General Tetsuzan Nagata, who was Chief of Military Bureau and the leader of the Tōseiha faction within the Imperial Japanese Army. The Tōseiha scored a victory in July 1935 when General Jinzaburō Masaki, one of the leaders of the Kōdōha faction was removed as Inspector General of Military Training. But Nagata was assassinated the next month(the Aizawa Incident). The struggle between the Tōseiha and Kōdōha factions continued below the surface of the government; and the war in North China carried on apace until February 1936. Hayashi also promoted Fumimaro Konoye's doctrines, as a "right-winger" amongst the militarists, who approved of the "fiction" of democracy, and the Emperor's role with an "adviser group", against "left-winger" radical militarists, led by Kingoro Hashimoto, wanted a Military Shogunate.

Born to a wealthy merchant family, Sanzo’s entry into Marxist circles has brought about respect from many avenues of Communist thought. Committed to the standing policy of cooperation between the countless interpretations and agencies of the Japanese Communist movement, Sanzo has thus far prevented internal collapse and disunity but at the price of a clear direction. His more modest, reformist ideals have also left many to hold him responsible for the Communist uprising’s inability to take control over the entire country early into the Liberal Republic’s collapse. While relatively respected by those outside the movement, this growing popular dissatisfaction internally may stop even Nosaka from holding the communist groups together."
  POLITICS_SUZUKI_DESC:0 "Suzuki was born the oldest child of Suzuki Masuji on September 4, 1885 in what is now Kurihara, Miyagi prefecture. When he was 10 years old he and his father converted to Christianity. His family began to struggle financially when Suzuki was in middle school, and by the time he reached high school he had to pay his own way through school. These circumstances and the influences of Honma Shunpei, a missionary, made him interested in social problems. He entered Tokyo Imperial University and with his upperclassman Sakuzō Yoshino, he began attending the Hongo Congregational Church ministered by Ebina Danjo. Influenced by the church's democratic atmosphere and sympathizing with Kumazō Kuwata's reformist ideas, Suzuki decided to become a social activist. After graduating from the university in 1909, Suzuki began working at what is now Dai Nippon printing. He got a job at the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun in 1910. He covered poverty. In 1911 he became the secretary of a Unitarian group that was headed by Abe Isoo. He also worked with a labor group. In 1912 he formed the Yūaikai with 14 other people, so that they could raise the status of laborers. Suzuki served as the chairman. Branches of the organization opened all over Japan, with a total of 51 by the end of 1915. In 1915 and 1916 Suzuki traveled to the United States to learn about labor unions there. While learning about labor rights and strike actions, he was inspired to push for all of the labor organizations to merge in order to obtain more bargaining power. In 1919, the Yūaikai renamed itself to the Nippon Rōdō Sōdōmei Yūaikai. By 1921, the organization became simply the Nippon Rōdō Sōdōmei, or the Japanese Federation of Labor. That year the group was able to convince 30,000 dock workers in Kobe to go on strike. In 1926 he helped to form the Social Democratic Party. During the 1928 Japanese general election, he was elected to the House of Representatives representing Osaka's 4th district. He was one of the eight people who were the first to be elected to the Diet without a political party affiliation. After losing his seat in 1930, he was reelected in 1936 as a member of the Shakai Taishūtō. In 1940, Saitō Takao was expelled from the Diet for making a speech questioning the "Holy War" in China. Suzuki supported him by leaving office along with several other Diet members. On March 12, 1946, Suzuki died in Sendai, Miyagi prefecture."

  POLITICS_KAGAWA_DESC:0 "was a Japanese Christian pacifist, Christian reformer, and labour activist. Kagawa wrote, spoke, and worked at length on ways to employ Christian principles in the ordering of society and in cooperatives. His vocation to help the poor led him to live among them. He advocated for women's suffrage and promoted a peaceful foreign policy. Kagawa was born in Kobe, Japan to a philandering businessman and a concubine. Both parents died while he was young. He was sent away to school, where he learned from two American missionary teachers, Drs. Harry W. Myers and Charles A. Logan, who took him into their homes. Kagawa learned English from these missionaries and converted to Christianity after taking a Bible class in his youth, which led to his being disowned by his remaining extended family. Kagawa studied at Tokyo Presbyterian College, and later enrolled in Kobe Theological Seminary. While studying there, Kagawa was troubled by the seminarians' concern for technicalities of doctrine. He believed that Christianity in action was the truth behind Christian doctrines. Impatiently, he would point to the parable of the Good Samaritan. From 1914 to 1916 he studied at Princeton Theological Seminary. In addition to theology, through the university's curricular exchange program he also studied embryology, genetics, comparative anatomy, and paleontology while at Princeton. In 1909 Kagawa moved into a Kobe slum with the intention of acting as a missionary, social worker, and sociologist. In 1914 he went to the United States to study ways of combating the sources of poverty. In 1916 he published Researches in the Psychology of the Poor based on this experience in which he recorded many aspects of slum society that were previously unknown to middle-class Japanese. Among these were the practices of illicit prostitution (i.e., outside of Japan's legal prostitution regime), informal marriages (which often overlapped with the previous category), and the practice of accepting money to care for children and then killing them. Kagawa was arrested in Japan in 1921 and again in 1922 for his part in labour activism during strikes. While in prison he wrote the novels Crossing the Deathline and Shooting at the Sun. The former was a semi-autobiographical depiction of his time among Kobe's destitute. After his release, Kagawa helped organize relief work in Tokyo following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and assisted in bringing about universal adult male suffrage in 1925. He organized the Japanese Federation of Labour as well as the National Anti-War League in 1928. Throughout this period, he continued to evangelize to Japan's poor, advocate women's suffrage and call for a peaceful foreign policy. Between 1926 and 1934 he focused his evangelical work through the Kingdom of God Movement. Arthur Miller writes about hearing Kagawa give an evangelical lecture in Hill Auditorium at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, in 1935, and describes him as "a merchant of the sublime." In 1940, Kagawa made an apology to the Republic of China for Japan's occupation of China, and was arrested again for this act. After his release, he went back to the United States in a futile attempt to prevent war between that nation and Japan. He then returned to Japan to continue his attempts to win women's suffrage. After Japan's surrender, Kagawa was an adviser to the transitional Japanese government. During his life, Kagawa wrote over 150 books. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1947 and 1948, and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1955."

As a direct descendant of the Southern Court emperors of the Nanboku-chō period, he argued that Emperor Hirohito was illegitimate. He pointed out that Hirohito's entire line is descended from the Northern Court emperors.

He attended the 37th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, graduating second out of a class of 179 cadets in 1909. As a midshipman, he was assigned to the cruiser Soya on its 1909 cruise from Dairen to Chemulpo, Chinkai, Sasebo and Tsu. He stayed with Soya on its cruise the following year to Manila, Ambon, Townsville, Brisbane, Sydney, Hobart, Melbourne, Fremantle, Batavia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Makung, and Keelung. On his return, he was assigned to the battleship Mikasa, and then the cruiser Kasuga. Shortly after his promotion to ensign on December 15, 1910, he was reassigned to the cruiser Kurama and attended the coronation ceremonies for King George V in London in 1911. In 1912, he returned to school to study latest naval artillery and submarine warfare techniques and was promoted to sub-lieutenant at the end of that year. In 1913, he served on the cruiser Takachiho, followed by the battleship Hiei. He was promoted to lieutenant at the end of 1915, and transferred to the battleship Fusō. Although Fusō participated in operations in World War I against the Imperial German Navy, Inoue was not in any combat situations. At the end of 1918, Inoue was appointed military attaché to Switzerland, and ordered by the Navy to learn German. In 1919, he was part of the Japanese diplomatic delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, where this knowledge proved to be useful. In 1920, he was appointed military attaché to France, and was then ordered to learn French. In December 1921, he received a promotion to lieutenant commander, and was permitted to return to Japan. After serving as executive officer on the Suma in 1923, Inoue enrolled in the Naval Staff College, graduating 3rd in a class of 21 the following year from the 22nd class. On December 1, 1925, he was promoted to commander. Inoue remained in staff positions for the next several years, including an appointment as naval attaché to Italy from 1927–1929, after which he was promoted to captain. On November 15, 1933, Inoue was given command of Hiei. However, his administrative talents could not be overlooked, and he returned to shore duties after slightly over a year and a half. Inoue was a protégé of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, and was strongly opposed to the Tripartite Pact with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Inoue was a leader of the "leftist clique" within the Japanese military, which opposed Japan's increasing trend towards fascism and overseas expansionism. Promoted to rear admiral on November 15, 1935, Inoue was made vice commander of the IJN 3rd Fleet, which covered the China theater of operations in 1939 and further promoted to vice admiral the same year. As with Yamamoto, he was a strong proponent of naval aviation. Inoue was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (first class) in 1940. In 1940, Inoue became commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy Aviation Bureau, and submitted his thesis for a radical restructuring of the Imperial Japanese Navy to Naval Minister Koshirō Oikawa early in 1941. He was highly critical of the Navy's shipbuilding programme, with its emphasis on battleships over aircraft carriers. Inoue was given command of the IJN Fourth Fleet later the same year, based out of Truk. He was thus in command of Japanese naval forces during the Battle of Guam and Battle of Wake Island. He subsequently relocated his headquarters to Rabaul for Operation Mo, intended to occupy Port Moresby. However, after the Japanese defeat at the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942, he was relieved of his command in October, and returned to Japan to become commander of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. He became Vice Minister of the Navy in the closing stages of World War II, was promoted to full admiral on May 15, 1945 (one of the last two promotions made to this rank), and officially retired on October 15 of the same year. After the war, Inoue became an English and music teacher to children at his house in Yokosuka. The site of his home is now a public park. His grave is at Tama Cemetery in Fuchū, Tokyo, Japan."
  POLITICS_TROTZKY_DESC:0 "was a Russian Marxist revolutionary, political theorist and politician. Ideologically a communist, he developed a variant of Marxism known as Trotskyism. Born to a wealthy Ukrainian-Jewish family in Yanovka (now Bereslavka), Trotsky embraced Marxism after moving to Nikolayev in 1896. In 1898, he was arrested for revolutionary activities and subsequently exiled to Siberia. He escaped from Siberia in 1902 and moved to London, where he befriended Vladimir Lenin. During the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ideological split, he sided with Julius Martov's Mensheviks against Lenin's Bolsheviks. Trotsky helped organize the failed Russian Revolution of 1905, after which he was again arrested and exiled to Siberia. He once again escaped and spent the following years working in Austria, Switzerland, France, Spain and the United States. After the 1917 February Revolution brought an end to the Tsarist monarchy, Trotsky returned to Russia and became a leader of the Bolshevik faction. As chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, he played a key role in the October Revolution which overthrew the new Provisional Government. Once in government, Trotsky initially held the post of the Commissar for Foreign Affairs and was involved in the Brest-Litovsk negotiations with Germany as Russia pulled out of the First World War. From March 1918 to January 1925, Trotsky was the head of the Red Army and played a vital role in the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War. He was one of the seven members of the first Politburo. After the death of Lenin and the rise of Joseph Stalin, Trotsky was removed from his positions and eventually expelled from the Soviet Union in February 1929. He spent the rest of his life in exile, writing prolifically and engaging in open critique of Stalinism. In 1938, Trotsky and his supporters founded the Fourth International in opposition to Stalin's Comintern. After surviving multiple attempts on his life, Trotsky was assassinated in August 1940 in Mexico City by Ramón Mercader, a Soviet NKVD agent. Written out of the history books under Stalin, Trotsky was one of the few Soviet political personalities who was not rehabilitated by the Soviet administration under Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s."

  POLITICS_DIET_DESC:0 "The houses of the Diet are both elected under parallel voting systems. This means that the seats to be filled in any given election are divided into two groups, each elected by a different method; the main difference between the houses is in the sizes of the two groups and how they are elected. Voters are also asked to cast two votes, one for an individual candidate in a constituency, and one for a party list. Any national of Japan at least 18 years of age may vote in these elections, reduced from age 20 in 2016. Japan's parallel voting system is not to be confused with the Additional Member System used in many other nations. The Constitution of Japan does not specify the number of members of each house of the Diet, the voting system, or the necessary qualifications of those who may vote or be returned in parliamentary elections, thus allowing all of these things to be determined by law. However it does guarantee universal adult suffrage and a secret ballot. It also insists that the electoral law must not discriminate in terms of "race, creed, sex, social status, family origin, education, property or income". Generally, the election of Diet members is controlled by statutes passed by the Diet. This is a source of contention concerning re-apportionment of prefectures' seats in response to changes of population distribution. For example, the Liberal Democratic Party had controlled Japan for most of its post-war history, and it gained much of its support from rural areas. During the post-war era, large numbers of people were relocating to the urban centers in the seeking of wealth; though some re-apportionments have been made to the number of each prefecture's assigned seats in the Diet, rural areas generally have more representation than do urban areas. The Supreme Court of Japan began exercising judicial review of apportionment laws following the Kurokawa decision of 1976, invalidating an election in which one district in Hyōgo Prefecture received five times the representation of another district in Osaka Prefecture. In recent elections the malapportionment ratio amounted to 4.8 in the House of Councillors (census 2005, Ōsaka/Tottori; election 2007, Kanagawa/Tottori) and 2.3 in the House of Representatives (election 2009, Chiba 4/Kōchi 3). Candidates for the lower house must be 25 years old or older and 30 years or older for the upper house. All candidates must be Japanese nationals. Under Article 49 of Japan's Constitution, Diet members are paid about ¥1.3 million a month in salary. Each lawmaker is entitled to employ three secretaries with taxpayer funds, free Shinkansen tickets, and four round-trip airplane tickets a month to enable them to travel back and forth to their home districts."

  POLITICS_PALACE_DESC:0 "Japan is the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world. In much the same sense as the British Crown, the Chrysanthemum Throne is an abstract metonymic concept that represents the monarch and the legal authority for the existence of the government. Unlike its British counterpart, the concepts of Japanese monarchy evolved differently before 1947 when there was, for example, no perceived separation of the property of the nation-state from the person and personal holdings of the Emperor. According to legend, the Japanese monarchy is said to have been founded in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu; Naruhito is the 126th monarch to occupy the Chrysanthemum Throne. The extant historical records only reach back to Emperor Ōjin, who is considered to have reigned into the early 4th century. In the 1920s, then-Crown Prince Hirohito served as regent during several years of his father's reign, when Emperor Taishō was physically unable to fulfill his duties. However, the Prince Regent lacked the symbolic powers of the throne which he could only attain after his father's death. The current Constitution of Japan considers the Emperor as "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people." The modern Emperor is a constitutional monarch. The metonymic meanings of "Chrysanthemum Throne" encompass the modern monarchy and the chronological list of legendary and historical monarchs of Japan."
