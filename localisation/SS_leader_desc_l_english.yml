  POLITICS_GREW_DESC:0 "An experienced diplomat, having served as ambassador for America in a variety of countries, Grew effectively acts as governor to America’s Naval Base and territory at Chiba. Acting as the voice of the United States advising and pressuring policy changes within the Japanese Republic, whom the Americans have historically propped up, Joseph Grew is both loyal to his country and concerned with Japan’s current path. Worried that current American meddling over Japanese democracy is strengthening the cause of those who seek to destroy America’s creation outright, Joseph is more open than most other Western governors in Japan to the prospect of weakening their clutch over Japan."
  POLITICS_SORIANO_DESC:0 "Successful industrialist, especially in the alcohol market, Andrés Soriano is the Philanthropist of the Pacific. Ever caring for the wellbeing of his employees, Soriano takes the same care into account when charged with the protection of both the commercial and civil interests of American influences in Japan."

MacArthur’s history had a history with Japan prior to his current posting in Chiba. Particularly inspecting the status of American naval stations across Shogunate Japan prior to the First World War. With additional experience in operations across the Pacific area and in the political field, while simultaneously not being a high-standing commissioned officer, MacArthur has been an easy choice for military guidance over America’s peripheral operations in Japan."
  POLITICS_FUJIMOTO_DESC:0 "The ringleader of the Communist movement in Hawaii, Charles Fujimoto has struck a deal for American Chiba to continue as an autonomous authority over the region while maintaining ideological cohesion with Leftist Japan.

 # Chugoku Military Junta
  POLITICS_HATA_DESC:0 "The successor to Kazushige Ugaki, Hata now commands as a warlord of warlords. The very existence of his state is borne out of the armies confidence in their right to govern Japan as a principled and uncorrupted force. Yet the years of stagnation by the military machine in the South has rapidly degraded the internal strength of the Republic’s old army. Hata is a warlord trying to bring order to a government of other warlords An impossible task. Whether Hata’s conviction will see him through or his leadership shall fall to the ambitions of those he commands remains to be seen."
  POLITICS_MUTO_DESC:0 "A native of Kyushu, Akira Mutō became infamous among the military ranks of Chugoku for his increasingly hardline views on dealing with the opposition to the Military Junta’s efforts to restore order and clarity to Japanese governance. It was this trait as a stickler for order than made him an ideal candidate for the fascist, ultranationalist government that has settled itself within the military government."
  baronmuto:0 "Born to an ex-samurai family within the Saga Domain, Mutō’s family lost its place following the Shogunate victory during the Boshin war. His lineage has since never buried the hatchet it festered for their poor choice of allegiance during the war. Despite being a staunch military man, Nobuyoshi Mutō has consequently made an ideal candidate to form a Pro-Royalist authority within the original military staff of Japan."
  POLITICS_HAMAI_DESC:0 "A relatively low-level civil servant within the civil administration for Hiroshima city under its military authority. Hamai become popular for his peripheral role in Pro-Democracy circles within Chugoku while it was under martial rule. With Chugoku now under its new democratic authority, Shinzo has been placed in charge of the local autonomous government to represent the interests of his people."
  POLITICS_YAMAKAWA_DESC:0 "A committed socialist, Hitoshi has come to power in his native region due to his past role in organising the Communist uprisings that occurred in Chugoku during the collapse of Japan. Still a popular among the socialists who have silently awaited his return, Hitoshi has now been charged with building up Marxist governance within the local communities and handling the reactionary influences embedded within the area."
  POLITICS_FUJITA_DESC:0 "The prominent civil servant for Hiroshima until gaining his present post, Wakami Fujita was notably apolitical during the military governance of Chugoku. Neither protesting their rule nor condoning it. His acceptance to contribute his experiences and abilities towards the Democratic Socialist elements who have taken prominence within Chugoku politics is therefore of little surprise."

  POLITICS_KATAYAMA_DESC:0 "The Social-Democratic Leader of the Ezo Republic, Tetsu has come to rule Ezo as a comfortable bridge between the winds of socialist change that swept through the Japanese Republic in 1930 and continued respect for the old democratic system prior to the July Crisis. While not at regular odds with the politics of the Tokyo government, President Katayama has continued to serve as one of the few regime leaders in Japan prepared to reconcile and cooperate with the Republic."
  POLITICS_ARAKI_DESC:0 "A descendant of the Samurai and born in Tokyo, Araki has become one of the many ethnic Japanese occupants of Ezo. Having traveled there as part of an arrangement for him to take the reins of protecting the nation under the Provisional Government’s reunification, Araki has taken full control as a result of the loose coalition of Rightist and the Ainu tribe-folk taking power."
  POLITICS_KIDO_DESC:0 "Born in Tokyo, one might be surprised to see Koichi in power within Hokkaido. But the Ezo Republic’s predominant electorate are the ethnic Japanese of the island; who do not particularly care if their representative is a local. Having previously worked in the civil service for agriculture, Kido is extremely familiar with the agricultural aspects of Hokkaido and as such has been placed in charge to protect the island’s economy."
  POLITICS_KITOKURO_DESC:0 "A native to modern day Kakegawa, Baron Kitokuro was neither born during the days before the Emperor’s exile nor held any particular fanatical monarchist values during the days of the Shogun running solo. However, his recent defection from the civil service to the political opportunities in the Kyoto government has seen him reach a position of interim governor for Ezo until it can be restored to the fold of the Empire of the Rising Sun."
  POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "A fervent anti-communist within the Siberian White Russians armies, Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov became the ringleader for the organisation of the exiled white russian troops and officers that fled to the safety of Northern Japan following their defeats in the Russian Far East. His militarist determination has since seen him rise to power; committed to rallying the Russian Right for one last majorly organised effort to contest Soviet power in Mother Russia."
  POLITICS_ISOO_DESC:0 "The renowned Christian Leftist, Abe Isoo, has been placed upon the gubernatorial chair of the Republic of Ezo. Known for his staunch commitment to peaceful change.

In the build-up to World War II, he began to give lectures for the conservative Verbond voor Nationaal Herstel (Alliance for National Recovery - VNH) led by Van Gybland Oosterhoff. In 1937, Seyffardt became a member of the Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging (NSB), and started writing articles for their publication Volk en Vaderland.

  POLITICS_WILHELMINA_DESC:0 "was Queen of the Netherlands from 1890 until her abdication in 1948. She reigned for nearly 58 years, longer than any other Dutch monarch. Her reign saw the First and the Second World Wars, as well as the Dutch economic crisis of 1933. The only child of King William III of the Netherlands and Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, Wilhelmina ascended to the throne at the age of 10 after her father's death in 1890, under her mother's regency. After taking charge of government, Wilhelmina was generally popular for maintaining Dutch neutrality during the First World War and solving many of her country's industrial problems. By that time, her business ventures made her the world's first female billionaire in dollars. She ensured that her family was one of seven European royal houses remaining in existence. Following the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, Wilhelmina fled to Britain and took charge of the Dutch government-in-exile. She frequently spoke to the nation over radio and came to be regarded as a symbol of the resistance. By 1948, she had already returned to the liberated Netherlands and was the only survivor of the 16 monarchs who were sitting on their thrones at the time of her coronation. Increasingly beset by poor health, Wilhelmina abdicated in favour of her daughter Juliana in September 1948 and retired to Het Loo Palace, where she died in 1962."

  POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "Emperor Showa has returned to the home of his ancient family. Decades of exile in the United Kingdom since the end of the Boshin War have come to an end. Since being smuggled back into the country with British backing via Osaka during the crisis in 1930, Emperor Showa has been growing ever more successful in his path to restoration. Once limited to little more than Kyoto, Hirohito’s cause has led to expansion through conquest and municipal defections alike. The history, promises and cause of the Monarchy have left few across the islands to outright despise the Young Emperor. But decades of Republican and Shogunate rule, combined with the reactionary cause that the imperial family backed during the Boshin War, has left Japan disillusioned with the perfection of monarchy. To many Hirohito is just another, albeit honourable, tyrant in this age of division."
  POLITICS_KOTOHITO_DESC:0 "Prince Kotohito was born in Kyoto on November 10, 1865 as the sixteenth son of Prince Fushimi Kuniye (1802–1875). His father was the twentieth head of the Fushimi-no-miya, one of the four shinnōke, branches of the Imperial Family which were eligible to succeed to the throne if the main line should die out. Since the infant mortality rate in the main imperial household was quite high, Emperor Kōmei, the father of Emperor Meiji, adopted Prince Kotohito as a potential heir. Prince Kotohito was thus the adopted brother of Emperor Meiji and a great uncle to both Emperor Shōwa and his consort, Empress Kōjun. Prince Kotohito was initially sent to Sambō-in monzeki temple at the age of three to be raised as a Buddhist monk, but was selected in 1872 to revive the Kan'in-no-miya, another of the shinnōke households, which had gone extinct upon the death of the fifth head, Prince Naruhito."

Sempill was known as "Master of Sempill" before succeeding his father to the titles of Lord Sempill and Baronet of Craigevar in 1934."

  POLITICS_CATROUX_DESC:0 "Unlike the other European territory leaders, Georges Catroux is not primarily a diplomat. Instead, Catroux is first and foremost a general. Assigned to the effectively French-controlled sphere over Kobe, General Catroux’s main task and responsibility has firstly been to cement French military control over the city following the breakdown of Japan; secondly to actually govern it. Catroux would sooner die than relinquish Kobe to an invader without direct orders from his government. But with war looming on the home continent, is there any Catroux can do to stop such an event with a skeleton garrison to man the city?"

In 1928 he was sent to serve in French Morocco and in 1934 he was sent to China as a military attaché with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Promoted to colonel, he was sent to Indochina by the Vichy government in November 1940. He fought in the brief war with Thailand between October 1940 and May 1941. By 1942 he had been promoted to brigadier-general and was in charge of all French troops in southern Vietnam, although the country was now under Japanese occupation. By 1944, Major-General Sabattier was commanding the Tonkin Division. He asked Lieutenant-General Eugène Mordant for permission to prepare to fight a guerrilla war in the event the Japanese chose to end French administration. This would have included establishing supply caches in the mountains. The request was refused. Anticipating a Japanese coup, Sabattier put his troops on armed exercise status on 8 March 1945. Although this was countermanded by Mordant, not all units heeded his order and some were prepared when, on 9 March, the Japanese staged a coup d'état and overthrew the French colonial government. Under Sabattier's command, about 6,000 men from the vicinity of Hanoi abandoned their camps in the wake of the Japanese coup and retreated west. Although he and the Provisional Government of the French Republic in Paris hoped to receive assistance from the American Fourteenth Air Force stationed in China, none was forthcoming. On 10 April 1945, the Paris government appointed Sabattier their delegate-general in Indochina with plenary civil and military authority. Ensconced in Dien Bien Phu, he concentrated on civil matters and left the military to Major-General Marcel Alessandri of the 2nd Tonkin Brigade. When the Japanese launched a campaign to destroy the French in the mountains, Sabattier led his soldiers on a retreat of 600 miles (970 km) to China in May. In all some 2,000 to 5,000 soldiers made it to China. There Sabattier was the highest-ranking military representative of the French government for three months. He was replaced as delegate-general on 15 August when Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu was appointed high commissioner. Sabattier returned to Paris at the end of 1945.

  POLITICS_YONAI_DESC:0 "Emperor Shōwa trusted Yonai's strong moral character. By July 1944, the situation of World War II was apparently against Japan. As for this difficult circumstance, the Imperial Japanese Navy was in a confusion. Supreme commanders of the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to appoint Yonai as the Minister of Navy because he had popularity and charisma enough to unite the Imperial Japanese Navy, although Yonai had already retired. To assign Yonai as the Minister of Navy, the Emperor's consent was necessary. Meanwhile, Admiral Suetsugu was also a candidate. The Emperor selected Yonai because Suetsugu was famous for his ambition, and allowed Yonai to be the Minister of Navy even though he was no longer in active service. This appointment demonstrated Shōwa's trust in Yonai because he is the only one person in the Imperial Japanese Navy's history to return from retirement and be posted to the supreme position as the Minister of Navy. After the Imperial Japanese Navy was defeated, the Emperor called Yonai to the palace. The Emperor amiably invited Yonai to have lunch together. After that, the Emperor said, "I really appreciated your duty and effort not to begin the war. I think we are not going to meet often like before". He put a pen and inkstone into a case and said, "These are the things that I have used. I would like to present this as a gift to you." This action is extremely rare because having presented the belongings of the Emperor is the supreme honor and the utmost expression of amiability."

Eventually, he saved enough money to attend radio technology courses at Norwich Technical College. When he ran out of money, he was arrested for attempting to cash a forged cheque in 1934. Bossard served six months hard labour, a fact he suppressed throughout most of his career. Bossard married his first wife, Ethel Isobel Brash, on 26 February 1941 at St Simon's Parish Church, Southsea."
  POLITICS_FULLER_DESC:0 "was a senior British Army officer, military historian, and strategist, notable as an early theorist of modern armoured warfare, including categorising principles of warfare. With 45 books and many articles, he was a highly prolific author whose ideas reached army officers and the interested public. He explored the business of fighting, in terms of the relationship between warfare and social, political, and economic factors in the civilian sector. Fuller emphasised the potential of new weapons, especially tanks and aircraft, to stun a surprised enemy psychologically. Fuller was highly controversial in British politics because of his support for the organised fascist movement. He was also an occultist and Thelemite who wrote a number of works on esotericism and mysticism."
  POLITICS_EDWARD_DESC:0 "was King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Empire, and Emperor of India, from 20 January 1936 until his abdication in December of the same year. Edward was born during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria as the eldest child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George V and Queen Mary. He was created Prince of Wales on his sixteenth birthday, seven weeks after his father succeeded as king. As a young man, Edward served in the British Army during the First World War and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father. While Prince of Wales, he engaged in a series of affairs that worried his father and British prime minister Stanley Baldwin. Edward became king on his father's death. As king, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing to Wallis Simpson, an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the Church of England, which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew the Baldwin government would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would have ruined his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch. When it became apparent he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, he abdicated. He was succeeded by his younger brother, George VI. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history. After his abdication, Edward was created Duke of Windsor. He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. Later that year, the couple toured Germany. During the Second World War, Edward was at first stationed with the British Military Mission to France, but after private accusations that he was a Nazi sympathiser, he was appointed Governor of the Bahamas. After the war, Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France. He and Wallis remained married until his death in 1972. Wallis died 14 years later."

With the isles in chaos, the Samurai aristocracy of central Japan hastily established their conservative rule in the region out of desperate preservation as violent communist uprisings swept across the corrupted republic. Their immediate choice was Tokugawa Iesato, the old shogun before their defeat during The Great War. Now the representative and protector of this ancient aristocracy, Iesato cannot afford to be known as the ruler to destroy the Shogunate twice."

  POLITICS_NOSAKA_DESC:0 "Calm, respectful and thoughtful. Sanzo Nosaka does not readily fit the stereotype of the fervorous and violent communist leader. Born to a wealthy merchant family, Sanzo’s entry into Marxist circles has brought about respect from many avenues of Communist thought. Committed to the standing policy of cooperation between the countless interpretations and agencies of the Japanese Communist movement, Sanzo has thus far prevented internal collapse and disunity but at the price of a clear direction. His more modest, reformist ideals have also left many to hold him responsible for the Communist uprising’s inability to take control over the entire country early into the Liberal Republic’s collapse. While relatively respected by those outside the movement, this growing popular dissatisfaction internally may stop even Nosaka from holding the communist groups together."

  POLITICS_DIET_DESC:0 "The houses of the Diet are both elected under parallel voting systems. This means that the seats to be filled in any given election are divided into two groups, each elected by a different method; the main difference between the houses is in the sizes of the two groups and how they are elected. Voters are also asked to cast two votes, one for an individual candidate in a constituency, and one for a party list. Any national of Japan at least 18 years of age may vote in these elections, reduced from age 20 in 2016. Japan's parallel voting system is not to be confused with the Additional Member System used in many other nations. The Constitution of Japan does not specify the number of members of each house of the Diet, the voting system, or the necessary qualifications of those who may vote or be returned in parliamentary elections, thus allowing all of these things to be determined by law. However it does guarantee universal adult suffrage and a secret ballot. It also insists that the electoral law must not discriminate in terms of "race, creed, sex, social status, family origin, education, property or income". Generally, the election of Diet members is controlled by statutes passed by the Diet. This is a source of contention concerning re-apportionment of prefectures' seats in response to changes of population distribution. For example, the Liberal Democratic Party had controlled Japan for most of its post-war history, and it gained much of its support from rural areas. During the post-war era, large numbers of people were relocating to the urban centers in the seeking of wealth; though some re-apportionments have been made to the number of each prefecture's assigned seats in the Diet, rural areas generally have more representation than do urban areas. The Supreme Court of Japan began exercising judicial review of apportionment laws following the Kurokawa decision of 1976, invalidating an election in which one district in Hyōgo Prefecture received five times the representation of another district in Osaka Prefecture. In recent elections the malapportionment ratio amounted to 4.8 in the House of Councillors (census 2005, Ōsaka/Tottori; election 2007, Kanagawa/Tottori) and 2.3 in the House of Representatives (election 2009, Chiba 4/Kōchi 3). Candidates for the lower house must be 25 years old or older and 30 years or older for the upper house. All candidates must be Japanese nationals. Under Article 49 of Japan's Constitution, Diet members are paid about ¥1.3 million a month in salary. Each lawmaker is entitled to employ three secretaries with taxpayer funds, free Shinkansen tickets, and four round-trip airplane tickets a month to enable them to travel back and forth to their home districts."
