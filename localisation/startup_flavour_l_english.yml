    startup_flavour.1.desc:0 "More than a bunch of fugitives, the fascists have managed to carve their own state. Their position is still weak though. All sorts of partisans are raging along the countryside, and even worse - fascist parties are anything but united. Right on Shikoku borders, a bunch of bigger threats grows. We should keep an eye on these Isles up north, who knows whom will they sell themselves to?"
    startup_flavour.1.a:0 "The Black Dragon shall prevail!"
    
    startup_flavour.2.t:0 "The ones that rule the Seas"
    startup_flavour.2.desc:0 "After the Naval Junta establishment, Admiralty quickly realized that running a country is not the same as running a fleet. Our army command is not as bad as it could be, neither it is good. Our civilian structures are being ruined by corruption. As soon as we put an end to the internal problems, we shall take a look on the lands of our formerly united motherland, and do what we obligated to: eviscerate Miltary Junta traitors."
    startup_flavour.2.a:0 "Holy duty to save the country!"
