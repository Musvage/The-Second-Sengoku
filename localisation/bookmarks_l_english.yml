 HOUSE_DIVIDED_NAME:0 "A House Divided"
 HOUSE_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "And yet again history repeats itself. Long after the Great Fratricide, better known to us as Sengoku Jidai, brothers by birth face each other in mortal combat, for glory and honour, for power and riches. But no war ever existed without the dark side. How long for shall we kill each other over and over again for no reason? Will ever we again prosper under imperial divinity or march relentlessly by the will of our people? Who shall save us or doom us for eternal chaos?"
 BHAA_NAME:0 "Between the Hammer and the Anvil"
 BHAA_DESC:0 "Though independence comes with great pride and glory, it also throws some unpleasant responsibilities. As far as any of them is of great importance, one is a grave matter, especially in such desperate times - state defence. Both enemies are encircled, which is the only factor that stops them from immediate war escalation. Will you help the enslaved workers to be freed by their comrades or will you fight for freedom till your last breath?"
 QOH_NAME:0 "Question of Honour"
 QOH_DESC:0 "The Good, the Bad and the Nazi. While the two last remnants of the Japanese Republican Armed Forces are trying not to let each other cut their throats, a new threat has risen almost out of nowhere. Japanese ultra-nationalists gathered under one banner to give everyone a worthy fight, and someone far away from our homeland is definitely connected to it. Will the swastika wave over the Home Isles, or it will be burned by the Rising Sun or even buried in the abyss under the Anchor?"
 SHO_HOUSE_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "The Tokugawa Shogunate has been restored to the central Japan. The collapse of order in the Japanese Republic in 1930 left Japan in anarchy. The Shogunate has since been restored to central Japan with the support of the traditionalists in the area. The Shogunate aims to provide a pretender government that certainly shows no military weakness. Fueled by increasingly popular propaganda about the ancient samurai, the local populace is militarising and prepared to take the Shogun’s warpath to the reunification of Japan."  
 KYU_QOH_DESC:0 "The Naval Junta in Kyushu never really intended to become a pretender government when it first formed. It was rather a protective act in the face of the army’s declaration of martial law throughout Japan. The army and naval had historically been rivals throughout the Japanese Republic’s time, and once the collapse occurred, the Navy acted to protect its independence in the army and to retaliate against the army. But now the Navy must secure its own objectives. To reorganise itself into a rivalling land-power and to prevent the army from gaining control of Japan."
 PRO_HOUSE_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "It has been over five years since the Republic of Japan collapsed. Once an economic beacon for foreign direct investment from the West, the prospect of investing or building assets in the Republic has become laughable. Due to their demilitarised status and dependency on the United States for protection, the jurisdiction of the Republic has shrunk to not much more than Tokyo. If the Republic is to survive, it must assess its situation and drive forward in a new direction to secure both itself and Japan’s future as a liberal democracy."
 EZO_BHAA_DESC:0 "As Japan tore itself apart in the early 1930’s, Ezo separated from Japan. The Republic of Ezo is a new country, with no history of independence prior, and with little nationalist spirit. It was founded out of a tactical decision of self-preservation rather than identity. The Social-Democratic Nation is run mostly by left-wing Japanese politicians who must now hold their state together until the Japanese Republic can re-establish itself as a stable government."
 CHU_QOH_DESC:0 "The Chugoku Military Junta came into being when the army attempted to declare an unpermitted state of martial law across Japan. While few beyond the army accepted the declaration of martial law, the army managed to consolidate its power in Chugoku as other lands took their own sides. Years on and the Military Junta now stands as Japan’s strongman, but increasingly irrelevant as supporters defect to the Imperials, Shogunates and Fascists. The army must either act fast if it is to prevent this decline from getting out of hand."
 TOH_BHAA_DESC:0 "The elites of the Provisional Republic, puppets of the West, now hide in the walls of Tokyo. Their nationalist goons vie for power among themselves in the south. The feudal Shogun and Royal overlords struggle to empower themselves in the centre. The time has come to strike. But there is no agreed upon interpretation of Communism and how to achieve it within the state. Divided and with the Soviets becoming increasingly annoyed with Communist inaction in Japan, the Peasant Republic must charter its course before the movement is crushed from without or within."
 KAN_HOUSE_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "The Emperor returns. The royalty has returned via British Osaka to Kyoto to call for a reunification of Japan under their Emperor. Hirohito promises much, having instituted many reforms outlined and planned by his father and grandfather during their exile. But Kyoto’s territories may soon be assaulted on all fronts by those who see the Emperor’s return as a threat. The court must decide how to react. Compromise with their historic foe, the Tokugawa Shogunate and restore things to their traditional way? Commit to their view of the Imperial prerogatives and independence? Or reform to a total democracy to reach a détente with the Republic?"
 SHI_QOH_DESC:0 "During the height of the collapse of the Republic, a desperate mission was made to the Seto Inland Sea. A band of nationalist and fascist politicians retreated from the chaos to the island of Shikoku, certain that all other opposition to the Socialists would fail, they organised a new cabinet of their own. Declaring their state, the fascist government led by Adachi Kenzo has since shown themselves to be committed to their own right to rule. But plagued by internal competition and surrounded by stronger foes, the Shikoku State needs to work out just how they’re going to survive the coming storm. More importantly, how are they going to come out of it on top?"
 AMC_HOUSE_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "Acquired in late 1918 by the United States of America after the fall of the Shogunate, the city now serves unofficially as America’s treaty port in Japan. Chiba now operates as a vital strategic location for American interests in Japan. Its proximity allows for the US to continue their defence of the Japanese Republic, and has been an economic boon for both the Japanese and Americans."
 KOB_HOUSE_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "Unlike American Chiba, French Kobe was not torn from the hands of a united Japan. But was rather the site of a “trade city”, along with Hirado and Osaka. In which France was provided preferential trade arrangements with Kobe to promote development. When Japan therefore began to collapse in on itself in 1930, French investments in Kobe were jeopardised. With little to no protection, France used their forces there to assume control. France has outright asserted Kobe as a new dependency within the French Empire. Kobe now provides a safe haven for Japanese industry and investment wishing to escape the threat of being ravaged in the civil war."
 HIR_QOH_DESC:0 "None would’ve expected the Netherlands to make a colonial incursion in Japan. Yet amidst economic strife, chaotic governments and impending nationalisation efforts, the Dutch made the first European move to seize control over their Japanese gateway city. Under the East Indies Fleet, the Dutch annexed the speck of land. Since this came before the Japanese Republic’s collapse, the move by the Dutch was met with global outcry. Now the region serves as a safe spot for those seeking to escape the nearby martial governments. But as Hitler’s Germany grows more and more restless back in Europe, it seems that the Dutch protection of Hirado may soon end."
 OSA_HOUSE_DIVIDED_DESC:0 "Much like French Kobe, British Osaka was acquired amidst the collapse of the Japanese Republic in 1930. The British already had 800 troops, the HMS Black Swan and the HMS Pheasant stationed in the city to confirm their protection of Osaka from the warlord governments. Since then, the British have used Osaka as a gateway to allow for the return of the Imperial Family. Osaka now provides a lifeline of munitions, arms and other goods to Kansai. Unlike the French, the British have a lot more support and resources trickling in from the British Isles to help their policies of supporting the Imperials."
