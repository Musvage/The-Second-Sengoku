## Originally, these were PRO-specific spirits. But they worked so well and so... modularly, that I made the a general mechanic (DuKe)

PRO_modifier_ruling_party_popularity = {
	war_support_factor = var:PRO_war_support_propaganda_bonus
	political_power_factor = var:PRO_politica_power_ban_extremism_bonus
	army_org_factor = var:PRO_organization_codes_of_conduct_bonus
	conscription_factor = var:manpower_popularity_bonus
	# legitimacy: handled directly by the unification code
}
