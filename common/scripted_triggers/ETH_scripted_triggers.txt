#scripted triggers for Ethiopia

#	NOTE FROM DUKE: these are only needed since every vanilla NSB officer corp spirit has them in their triggers, and it's easier for us to copy/paste that file and add our custom spirits to a specific file
#   so we have to duplicate this ETH file (since we replace_plath the whole folder). I'm cutting all the fat from it

# Does Ethiopia (or anyone else that want to use this) have a Military Academy? 
# Add triggers for those countries as needed 
has_military_academy = {
	custom_trigger_tooltip = {
		tooltip = has_military_academy_tt 
		always = yes
	}
}


# Does Ethiopia (or anyone else that want to use this) have a Naval Academy? 
# Add triggers for those countries as needed 
has_naval_academy = {
	custom_trigger_tooltip = {
		tooltip = has_naval_academy_tt 
		always = yes
	}
}

# Does Ethiopia (or anyone else that want to use this) have an Air Force Academy? 
# Add triggers for those countries as needed 
has_air_academy = {
	custom_trigger_tooltip = {
		tooltip = has_air_academy_tt 
		always = yes
	}
}
# Does Ethiopia (or anyone else that want to use this) have an established Air Force? 
# Add triggers for those countries as needed
