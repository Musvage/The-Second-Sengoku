Hey, Teuty here!

How to use Shinemaker:

1: Put all the GFXs of the focuses in a interface file the code should look like:

	SpriteType = {
	name = "GFX_focus_name"
	texturefile = "gfx/interface/goals/focus_name.dds"			
	}	
	

2: Then change the file name to KR_goals.gfx

3: run the shinegoalmaker and put in the folder's name: The-Second-Sengoku (for me)

4: it should do it's thing

5: rename the KR_goals_shine.gfx to your country's name

6: Profit?

PS: No this isn't a virus that will steal your info, it's a risk to the computer because it's a .exe file, which for computers is spooky
